# SWITCH Version 2 Content Repair
Restoring content to version 2 of SWITCH in order to improve the copy archived in SJSU ScholarWorks

This archive of the SWITCH journal site was created using HTTrack. This repository contains volumes 1-18 of SWITCH in the v2 format. Many articles in v2 are missing text and image content from the originally published (v1) version. The purpose of this repository is to work towards a workflow to address those problems.

Articles are in the folder nextswitch-copy/switch-engine/front. These articles have been altered to address accessibility issues. The original HTML of the articles can be found in nextswitch-copy/replaced_files.

Choose one article from the spreadsheet of article needing repair. Clone this repository and edit the copy of that article in nextswitch-copy/switch-engine/front to match the version 1 article. Push changes to this repository. The library will use your updated HTML file to generate a new PDF file for the article.
