<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch Interviews Laurel: Gender Issues</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><H3>Gender and Sex; Biology and Culture </H3><HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=left><BR>JC: Virtual reality is a transitory reality. Judith Butler writes in herbook <CITE>Gender Trouble</CITE> (New York: Routledge, 1990): &quot;Genderought not be constructed as a stable identity as a locus of agency fromwhich various acts followp; rather gender is an identity tenuously constitutedin time, instituted in exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts.&quot;Do you think VR will serve to make more evident the subjective and transitorynature of identity? Will the perceived necessity to define gender becomeunimportant? <BR><BR>BL: That's already true in some ways. I mean, we've already seen that onthe cover of Newsweek magazine. ... It's certainly true that the <STRONG><A HREF="performative.html">performative</A></STRONG>aspects of gender come into focus when you're working in an environmentwhere you're representing the self as an avatar. It involves the unexpectedconstruction of a self that can be more intimate than we're allowed to presentin more traditional, actual-world social settings. <BR><BR>I think this is important. I've been doing some work in this area over thepast couple of years. I believe that there are actual brain-based and <STRONG><A HREF="physiological.html">physiological</A></STRONG>differences between the sexes. <BR><BR>It's not as easy as saying 'I'll just put on my boy hat now.' The dancebetween biological and cultural differences is not well understood, andI think a certain flavor of feminist tends to de-emphasize the biologicalaspect and that's not a particularly good thing to do if you're trying tointervene. <BR><BR>JC: Perhaps what needs to be happening is addressing the issues, researchingthem, not just discounting them conclusively on the basis of political reasons.<BR><BR>(continued...)<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"><BR><BR></A><A HREF="embody.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="VR and Disembodiment"></A><A HREF="future.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="The Future and VR"></A> </BODY>
