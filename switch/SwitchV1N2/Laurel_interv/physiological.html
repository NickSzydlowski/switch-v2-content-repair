<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch Interviews Laurel: Physiological Aspects</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><H4>VR and Physiological Aspects of Gender<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left></H4>JC: Do you mean x- and y-chromosomes? <BR><BR>BL: Yes, things that come from that, anyway. Things like differences invision. Roughly twenty percent of women are tetra-chromatic, which meanstheir ability to perceive color is much higher than anyone else's. Thereare differences in cognitive ability also that have to do with when andhow much androgen exposure there is to the brain of a developing child,etc. There are other physiological differences that are just the artifactsof development, because so much of our visual system is soft-wired untiladolescence. <BR><BR>Amy Brockman has some interesting information about girls using her 'mud'environment. Girls are much more likely to perform male or non-genderedcharacters; some ridiculously low number like zero percent actually performfemale roles, whereas the males were much more likely to play male characters,to pass their actual gender through to their character. That is kind ofsad. So there is a real opportunity for people to make environments wherethere's some positive value in performing 'female,' I should think! <BR><BR>(continued...)<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"><BR><BR></A><A HREF="gender.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="VR and Gender"></A><A HREF="future.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="The Future and VR"></A> </BODY>
