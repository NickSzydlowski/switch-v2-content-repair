<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch Interviews Laurel: Examples</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><H4>Examples of Experiencing Other-ness<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left></H4>BL: One example is video telepresence -- remote telepresence -- which alreadysort of does that. Like some of the early work of Scott Fisher at NASA Ames:large, remote robotic arms, twenty times stronger than your own and maybetwenty times as large as your body. (It's such a boy thing!...) You canbe this large powerful entity for real. One of the issues there was thatpeople would swing this arm around and break things because they didn'thave a notion of how large it was, compared to their own body. That's kindof a primitive example of remote telepresence.<BR><BR>Another very exciting application is journalism, with remote telepresencefrom places like war zones, where now you have a person holding a microphonein front of a camera. In terms of doing anything more sensitive, if youcould identify with someone in the streets of Israel during a confrontation...but social content that's generated, as opposed to a by-product of remotepresence, is a much harder problem. In literature an author can say selectivelywhat a character does and feels, through a stream-of-consciousness narration.<BR><BR>(continued...)<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left><BR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"><BR><BR></A><A HREF="other.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="VR and the Other"></A><A HREF="language.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Language and VR"></A></BODY>
