<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch Interviews Laurel: Performative Aspects</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><H4>Performative Aspects of VR<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left></H4>BL: In a classical VR context, not a 'mud' VR environment, the idea of walkingan avatar around for someone else to see and respond to in a special way,emphasizes the performative aspects of gender. There may be some changeof consciousness in people's minds of what gender is. I think it's likely,as has been true in the text-based world, that it is increasingly the casethat gender is de-emphasized as a trait that we communicate socially. Myguess is that this is because identifying oneself as this or that gender,either by coded representation or by labeling, brings up a whole lot ofpredictable behavior. Often what we're after when we design an avatar isan experience that is stimulating and invigorating. <BR><BR>(continued...)<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"><BR><BR></A><A HREF="gender.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="VR and Gender"></A><A HREF="physiological.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3></A></BODY>
