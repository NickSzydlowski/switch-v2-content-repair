Would you elaborate upon these other modelsof interaction and talk about what has not been accounted for? <BR><BR>BL: I would put them in two basic sets. One says that VR is 'out of body,'an approach that takes on a couple of different flavors. For instance, thetechno-ubiquitous fantasy of 'I'm everywhere' omniscence, the classic super-herostuff. There's also a fairly big, serious group looking at that as a spiritualopportunity. There was a piece done at MIT about the arctic, wolves andother animals, with lots of interesting p.o.v.'s. Some of them wouldn'tbe possible for any kind of body that I could construct with my imagination,yet would have enough characteristics of a bodied experience to really involveyou.
