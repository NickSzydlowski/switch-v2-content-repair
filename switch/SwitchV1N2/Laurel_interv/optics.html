I'm impressedwith the rapid advances in computing in the past two years, just in thespeed of machine required to run 60 field-per-second video, but what causesheadaches is a lack of visual convergence in rendering near field objects.<BR><BR>JC: You mean the sick stomach feeling we hear about? <BR><BR>BL: Well, yes -- that is a slightly different issue... but they're related....

Our general feeling is theobject situation will start improving when we start employing servos ormicro-machines to dynamically adjust and compensate for those gnarly littleconvergence issues. <BR><BR>(continued...)<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"><BR><BR></A><A HREF="Laurel_intro.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Interviews Laurel"></A><A HREF="other.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="VR and The Other"></A></BODY>
