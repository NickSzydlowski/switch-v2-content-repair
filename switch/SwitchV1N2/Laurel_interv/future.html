<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch Interviews Laurel: The Future</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><H3>Conclusion: VR and the Future of Our Relationship with Computers <BR><BR><HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=left></H3>JC: Would you like to say anything in closing? <BR><BR>BL: Yes. The main point of the Scientific American article was that I thinkVR holds great promise for changing the ethos of computing. That is, oursense of what computers are, what they're 'like,' and what they have todo with us. My favorite metaphor for this is that computers have sort ofevolved as this race of severed heads, brains-in-boxes. That is the wayinterfaces have worked and been treated for quite some time. <BR><BR>JC: If even that good... <BR><BR>BL: Right. So to say, 'This is a whole <STRONG><A HREF="gender.html">body</A></STRONG>deal,' suggests that what's going on with the body is just as importantas what is going on with the brain. That's an enormously important thinghere in the twentieth century, here at the end of Descartes' 'little train.'We've gone the whole distance with mind-body dualism and it's time to re-examinethis. Our mistake number one: to state that our minds and bodies are separate.Mistake number two: to state that these little brains-in-boxes can takecare of just about anything. <BR><BR><HR SIZE=7 ALIGN=left><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif"WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"></A></BODY>
