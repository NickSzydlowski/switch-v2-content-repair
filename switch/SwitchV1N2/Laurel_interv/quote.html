<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch Interviews Laurel: Lanier Quote</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><H4>VR and Language<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left></H4>The Jaron Lanier quote is as follows: <BLOCKQUOTE>Let's suppose that you could have a time machine go back tothe earliest creatures who developed languagae, our ancestors at some point,and give them Virtual Reality clothing. Would they have developed language?I suspect not, because as soon as you can change the world in any way, thatis a mode of expression of utter power and eloquence; it makes descriptionseem a bit limited .... [The idea of] post-symbolic communication... meansthat when you're able to improvise reality as you can in Virtual Reality,and when that's shared with other people, you don't really need to describethe world any more because you can simply make any contingency. You don'treally need to describe an action because you can create any action [Lanierinterview in Heilbrun, 1989].</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=left><BR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"><BR><BR></A><A HREF="language.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Language and VR"></A></BODY>
