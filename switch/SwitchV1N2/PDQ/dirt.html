<HEAD>    <TITLE>VR.Dirt and Other Stuff</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#66a8a8 TEXT=#580a72 LINK=#d7348f VLINK=#3d003d><H2>VR Dirt and Other Stuff</H2><HR SIZE=5><BR><BR>It seemed like no matter which VR class, paper or <BR><BR>panel I attended, and I attended several of them, the <BR><BR>same issues kept coming up: Concerns about the <BR><BR>physiological and psychological effects of VR systems <BR><BR>on users, the need for more useful interfaces, and the <BR><BR>desire to provide more sensuous feedback to users. <BR><BR>In fact, all of these issues came up during the panel on <BR><BR>&quot;A National Research Agenda for Virtual Reality: Report <BR><BR>by the National Research Council Committee on VR <BR><BR>R&amp;D&quot; (NRCC). The panelists presented recommen-<BR><BR>dations made by the committee which have been pub-<BR><BR>lished in a new book, <CITE>Virtual Reality: Scientific and <BR><BR>Technological Challenges</CITE>. <H4><BR>Physiological</H4><BR>The physiological and psychological effects of VR <BR><BR>systems will be a deciding factor in the development <BR><BR>of VR as a useful technology. Symptoms such as eye <BR><BR>strain, motion sickness, <STRONG><A HREF="sopite.html">sopite syndrome</A></STRONG>and others <BR><BR>associated with prolonged use of HMD's must be ad-<BR><BR>dressed before VR can become a practical technology <BR><BR>and environment to use and work in. One panelist, <BR><BR>Randy Pausch of the University of Virginia, mentioned <BR><BR>a Sega VR HMD which was supposed to be released <BR><BR>but was never heard of again after Sega commissioned <BR><BR>a study of the effects of long term use of HMDs. No <BR><BR>news in this case may not necessarily be good news. <BR><BR>Reasearchers were unable to say conclusively whether <BR><BR>prolonged exposure to the HMD would not be harmful. <BR><BR>The researchers made no statements that it was harmful, <BR><BR>just that it was impossible to say it was harmless. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Pausch later suggested that these kinds of issues make <BR><BR>or break an industry and that if there was any threat of <BR><BR>lawsuits companies may be reluctant to invest in products <BR><BR>that may place them in jeopardy. To address these con-<BR><BR>cerns, the NRCC recommended further research into the <BR><BR>physiological and psychological side effects of VR. <BR><BR><H4>Psychological<BR></H4>Although physiological side effects where addressed in <BR><BR>more detail at the conference, psychological side effects <BR><BR>of VR were mentioned and are discussed in the NRCC <BR><BR>publication. In the report, questions are posed regarding <BR><BR>the effects of extended exposure to VR systems on the <BR><BR>users sense of presence in their usual environment, on <BR><BR>the possibility of altering the mental model held of the <BR><BR>user's own body, and on attitudes toward social behaviors <BR><BR>such as sex, violence, and fantasy role playing. The report <BR><BR>seems to suggest that immersive experiences in VR may <BR><BR>have a greater impact than computer role playing games. <BR><BR><BR><BR>There have been reports of individuals giving up most of <BR><BR>their real lives and identities for these fantasies. There is <BR><BR>also some evidence that violent video games may be con-<BR><BR>nected to aggressive behavior in children. It is important <BR><BR>to remember that there is a great deal of research that needs <BR><BR>to be done before any of this can be substantiated and the <BR><BR>NRCC recommends that more research should be conducted <BR><BR>to examine the possibility of these side effects. <BR><BR><H4>Interfaces</H4><BR>During several of the VR panels, projects were discussed <BR><BR>that incorporated the use of physical interfaces. Ian Angus <BR><BR>of Boeing Corporation presented a CAD system that incor-<BR><BR>porated a clipboard that is used as an input device. In his <BR><BR>presentation, he emphasized the benefit of using physical <BR><BR>devices to orient users in virtual environments. Physical <BR><BR>devices provide users with the ability to feel objects in these <BR><BR>environments as opposed to reaching out into an empty <BR><BR>space to push a button or bring up a menu. In this case, <BR><BR>the clipboard corresponded to a panel in the virtual environ-<BR><BR>ment which allowed access to menus and diagrams. Angus <BR><BR>pointed out that one of the limitations of his device was that <BR><BR>it was too small to view large diagrams. But this seemed <BR><BR>to be a problem that could be addressed through software <BR><BR>by adding features that allowed you to zoom into a specific <BR><BR>area of a diagram or by allowing you to change the size <BR><BR>relationship between the input device and the image display. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Randy Pausch also presented several projects developed at <BR><BR>the<A HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~uigroup/"> <STRONG>University ofVirginia Department of Computer <BR><BR>Science</STRONG></A> that incorporated unusual interfaces such as a tennis<BR><BR>ball and a toy bow and arrow. These were pretty amusing to <BR><BR>watch and the audience had a good laugh. But fun and games <BR><BR>aside, these projects illustrate the ease with which users can <BR><BR>relate to virtual environments when provided with tangible <BR><BR>interfaces. <BR><BR><H4>Feedback<BR></H4>Haptic devices are the next big step in achieving more sen-<BR><BR>suous and vivid experiences in VR. To make virtual environ-<BR><BR>ments useful and far more enticing, <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/eve/eve-articles/I.C.ForceTactile.html"><STRONG>sensoryoutput</STRONG> </A>will <BR><BR>have to be provided to users. Aside from the <A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/handarm-haptics/haptics.html"><STRONG>PHANToM</STRONG><BR><BR></A>there were few haptic devices used in VR systems presented <BR><BR>at any of the panels. This is probably due to the fact that a <BR><BR>large proportion of VR research is dedicated to visual and <BR><BR>audio feedback.
