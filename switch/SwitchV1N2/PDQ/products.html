<HEAD>    <TITLE>VR Products</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#66a8a8 TEXT=#580a72 LINK=#d7348f VLINK=#3d003d><H2>VR Products</H2><HR SIZE=5><H4>I eye i-Glasses</H4><IMG SRC="../../../../switch/SwitchV1N2/PDQ/copy_of_.html" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=108 CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALIGN=middle><BR><BR><BR>Virtual I/O's <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.vio.com/VIO/vio-prodinfo.html">i-Glasses</A></STRONG>are one of the coolest products <BR><BR>I saw at the conference. Even in spite of their low resolution <BR><BR>these are one of the best head mounted displays (HMD) <BR><BR>available for the money, although still somewhat prohibitive <BR><BR>in price for most of us. I tried them out while playing Descent,<BR><BR>a Doom-like 3D Computer Game. They were a real kick. The <BR><BR>i-Glasses were lightweight, unlike many of the other HMDs <BR><BR>I've used. They also provide you with the option of being <BR><BR>fully immersed in your virtual world or, by removing a detach-<BR><BR>able cover, seeing the real world in the peripheral space around <BR><BR>the image screen. I checked this feature out at my local retailer <BR><BR>while simultaneously watching Space Ghost on TV and all of <BR><BR>the other shoppers stare at me. It was a surreal experience. I <BR><BR>highly recommend it. The i-Glasses come in a standard version <BR><BR>for TV and video game viewing ($599) and a PC version with <BR><BR>an optional head tracking module ($799). <BR><H4><HR WIDTH=64%><BR><BR>Smart Model/Smart Product</H4><BR><BR>Another cool product on view at Siggraph was <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.sbwinc.com/MultiGen/">Multigen's</A></STRONG><BR><BR>Smart Model. Smart Model is an amazing new 3D modeling <BR><BR>package that incorporates the use of an HMD and <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Products/appsdirectory.dir/Applications/Peripherals/ApplicationNumber116960.html">PinchGloves</A></STRONG> <BR><BR>to construct and manipulate 3D models and move around within <BR><BR>your virtual workspace. I was mesmerized while watching the <BR><BR>demos at the Multigen booth. The demonstrator would simply <BR><BR>reach forward with both hands, press his thumb and finger <BR><BR>together, and pull himself through a scene. And just as easily, <BR><BR>he would reach out, pick up objects and move or modify them. <BR><BR>It was like a scene right out of the Johnny Mnemnonic movie. <BR><BR>Smart Model also has 3D browsers and toolsets that you can <BR><BR>call up and use within your virtual workspace. According to <BR><BR>Multigen, this product is so simple and intuitive to use that &quot;non-<BR><BR>technical&quot; users can begin building models and scenes in no time.<H4><HR WIDTH=67%><BR><BR>Turbo Kourier</H4><BR><BR>Although not exactly a true VR system in my book, Vivid Group's <BR><BR>Mandala Virtual World system allows you to engage more that <BR><BR>just your eyes and hands while playing it's new title Turbo <BR><BR>Courier. The Mandala system is a Location Based Entertainment <BR><BR>(LBE) system that utilizes video cameras and chroma key tech-<BR><BR>nology to superimpose the player's image onto a videogame <BR><BR>scene which appears on a monitor in front of the player. In <BR><BR>Turbo Kourier, players control a skyboard -- a Jetsons-like <BR><BR>skateboard that flies through the air -- by ducking, jumping, <BR><BR>and moving left and right. The goal is to avoid the bad guys <BR><BR>and collide with others to earn points. I was actually winded <BR><BR>at the end of the game but I had fun playing. <BR><H4><HR WIDTH=61%><BR><BR>3D Virtual Theater? or not?<BR></H4>Straylight Corporation has a long way to go before their 3D <BR><BR>Virtual Theaters are going to be worth my hard-earned cash. <BR><BR>This virtual experience fell short of the claims that Straylight <BR><BR>made in their promotional materials. Their virtual theater <BR><BR>consisted of about 10 chairs with HMDs. Our virtual exper-<BR><BR>ience titled &quot;U.F.O. - Upon Further Observation&quot; took us <BR><BR>through an alien abduction of a little boy who we watch fry <BR><BR>ants with a magnifying glass in the opening scene. After the <BR><BR>boy is beamed up to the ship, we see the aliens and their <BR><BR>spaceship from the boy's point of view. Actually there were <BR><BR>several times that it was unclear which p.o.v. we were seeing. <BR><BR>The graphics in this virtual film were also less than desirable; <BR><BR>the characters were poorly animated and rendered. But the <BR><BR>most irritating element of this experience was the &quot;motion seat&quot;<BR><BR>which rumbled through the entire animation for no apparent <BR><BR>reason that I could detect. The rumbling never seemed to <BR><BR>coincide with any particular event and it never stopped. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Imagining a virtual theater in which the audience &quot;experiences <BR><BR>a journey through cyberspace together&quot; is enticing. Visions <BR><BR>of the holodeck, or experiences that allow a number of viewers <BR><BR>to control the experience on some level, come to mind. But <BR><BR>don't expect any of this in &quot;UFO.&quot; The experience was not <BR><BR>virtual and I have doubts about its definition as theater. <BR><H4><HR WIDTH=65%><BR><BR>Red Planet/Dead World</H4><BR>Red Planet by Virtual World Entertainment Inc., a software <BR><BR>title that runs on their Tesla LBE virtual reality gaming system, <BR><BR>is another example of a good idea that didn't quite go all the <BR><BR>way. Unlike Straylight's virtual theater, Red Planet is inter-<BR><BR>active. The problem is that it isn't immersive. Unless you <BR><BR>consider sitting in a cockpit and watching a monitor immersive. <BR><BR>Red Planet is a 3D (albeit viewed on a 2D monitor) interactive, <BR><BR>multi-user racing game. The goal in Red Planet is to complete <BR><BR>as many laps as possible in the allotted time through &quot;the canals <BR><BR>of Mars,&quot; a race track reminiscent of the Star Wars Death Star <BR><BR>canal scene. They even have huge reactors with energy beams <BR><BR>projecting from them at each end of the race course. A few <BR><BR>simple changes and this video game would have become more <BR><BR>of an experience. The simple addition of an HMD or a larger <BR><BR>screen with a cockpit that moves or provides some sort of <BR><BR>physical feedback would have made this a much more thrilling <BR><BR>experience. I guess as video games go, this one is entertaining. <BR><BR>But as a virtual experience it fails. I probably would have been <BR><BR>more disappointed if I had paid for it. <BR><H4><HR WIDTH=68%><BR><BR>Venturer S-2</H4><BR><BR>A roller coaster at Siggraph? Yes, you heard it. Venturer S-2 <BR><BR>is an LBE system by Thomson Entertainment Systems. This <BR><BR>is more like an amusement park ride a la Star Tours. Riders <BR><BR>enter a small pod which holds two people (larger models hold <BR><BR>up to 14 people). A panel on the dash of the pod has several <BR><BR>buttons used to select your choice of several different rides. <BR><BR>Alas, the demo had only one choice. Once started, the pod <BR><BR>moves in conjunction with images that appear on the monitor/<BR><BR>window to simulate your ride on a futuristic, otherworldly <BR><BR>roller coaster. The best part is when the car flies off the <BR><BR>tracks, and then lands on another set after flying in the air <BR><BR>for a few seconds. This happens at several points along <BR><BR>the course of the ride. It wasn't as effective as Star Tours <BR><BR>but it combined elements of the Tesla cockpit and the Star-<BR><BR>light theater much more effectively. <BR><BR><BR>(continued...)<HR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3><BR><BR></A><A HREF="VRware_intro.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3></A><A HREF="project.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3></A></BODY>
