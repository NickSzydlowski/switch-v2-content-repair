Of course, I went <BR><BR>with a great deal of enthusiasm and visions of fully <BR><BR>immersive, fully interactive, forced feedback VR sys-<BR><BR>tems dancing in my head. I had seen all of the film and <BR><BR>television depictions of VR. And I had seen all of the <BR><BR>media hype about VR these past few years. Now I was <BR><BR>finally going to see what was really out there. <BR><BR><BR><BR>For the most part, I was disappointed. I was expecting to <BR><BR>be wowed by the VR products and entertainment offered <BR><BR>at the conference, but I wasn't. There were a few standouts <BR><BR>in the crowd though, and these few products seemed even <BR><BR>more impressive when compared to the rest. But new <STRONG><A HREF="products.html">products</A></STRONG><BR><BR>were only part of the VR offering at Siggraph -- there were a <BR><BR>number of informative <STRONG><A HREF="dirt.html">courses, papers and panels</A></STRONG>that <BR><BR>offered some insights into the potential for VR as well as the <BR><BR>pitfalls of this infant industry. Among the highlights were <BR><BR>products by Virtual I/O, The Vivid Group and Multigen Inc., <BR><BR><STRONG><A HREF="project.html">research projects</A></STRONG> at GeorgiaInstitute of Technology, the <BR><BR>University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and discussions <BR><BR>concerning haptic devices, physical interfaces and their <BR><BR>necessity in virtual environments, and the physiological and <BR><BR>psychological side effects of VR on users. <BR><BR><BR><BR>(continued...)<HR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3 ALT="Switch Table of Contents"></A><br><br><A HREF="products.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3></A></BODY>
