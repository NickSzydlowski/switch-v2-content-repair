<HEAD>    <TITLE>VR.Projects</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#66a8a8 TEXT=#580a72 LINK=#d7348f VLINK=#3d003d><H2>VR Projects</H2><HR SIZE=6 WIDTH=93%><H4>Nanomanipulator</H4><BR>Several university projects stood out as some of the most <BR><BR>promising research in the field of virtual reality. The most <BR><BR>fascinating of these projects is the <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.cs.unc.edu/nano/etc/www/nanopage.html">Nanomanipulator</A></STRONG>.<BR><BR>Developed at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill <BR><BR>Department of Computer Science in conjunction with the <BR><BR>UCLA Department of Chemistry in 1991. The project was <BR><BR>first presented at Siggraph in 1993 but has since gone <BR><BR>through several modifications. The Nanomanipulator incor-<BR><BR>porates a scanning tunneling microscope connected to a real-<BR><BR>time virtual reality interface with images generated by a Pixel-<BR><BR>Planes 5 graphics engine. It allows users to see and manipulate <BR><BR>microscopic structures which were previously only visible <BR><BR>through an electron microscope in a two dimensional image <BR><BR>on a monitor. <BR><BR><BR>In 1994, an atomic force microscope was added to manipulate <BR><BR>microscopic particles. In the videotape shown by Warren <BR><BR>Robinett, who conceived of the interface in cooperation with <BR><BR>Stan Williams of UCLA, gold particles were moved across a <BR><BR>gold substrate by the nanomanipulator. The most recent <BR><BR>addition to the project is a haptic device called <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/handarm-haptics/haptics.html">PHANToM</A></STRONG><BR><BR>which fits over the finger and provides forced feedback, <BR><BR>allowing the operator to feel the surface being manipulated. <H4><HR WIDTH=63%><BR><BR>Augmented Reality</H4><BR>Also developed at the Chapel Hill Department of Computer <BR><BR>Science, is the <STRONG><A HREF="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/azuma_AR.html">AugmentedReality Project</A></STRONG> which incor-<BR><BR>porates ultrasound data to create three dimensional images of <BR><BR>the human body allowing one to see beneath the surface without <BR><BR>actually opening it up. The project presented at the confer-<BR><BR>ence allows doctors to see 3D images of tissue, in this case <BR><BR>a woman's breast, which appear over the actual breast. In <BR><BR>this case, the subject was only being examined for a cyst <BR><BR>believed to be benign, but needed to be aspirated. The hope <BR><BR>is that doctors will soon be able to use the HMD to perform <BR><BR>procedures such as cyst aspiration. Project developers also <BR><BR>hope that seeing anatomical structures in 3D will make it easier <BR><BR>to get a sense of where the target (the cyst) is, reduce the time <BR><BR>it takes to train MDs to do procedures such as cyst aspiration, <BR><BR>and possibly reduce the time it takes to do such procedures. <BR><BR><BR><BR>It would seem that another possible benefit would be that <BR><BR>viewing internal structures using this technology would <BR><BR>facilitate medical procedures with minimal incisions, especially <BR><BR>with procedures such as this. At present the HMD does not <BR><BR>provide 3D images but researchers are hoping to be able to <BR><BR>perform the procedure with a 3D HMD within a year. <H4><HR WIDTH=64%><BR><BR>Phobia Project</H4><STRONG><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/virtual/Phobia">The PhobiaProject</A></STRONG>, developed by the Georgia Tech Graphics <BR><BR>Visualization and Usability Center explores the use of virtual <BR><BR>environments for behavioral therapy. Currently they are working <BR><BR>on a treatment for acrophobia, the fear of heights. Subjects can <BR><BR>use this system to enter three virtual environments which allow <BR><BR>them to take an elevator up 49 floors, cross three bridges which <BR><BR>span a river running through a canyon, or step out onto a series <BR><BR>of outdoor balconies. <BR><BR><BR><HR><BR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3><BR><BR></A><A HREF="products.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3></A><A HREF="dirt.html"><IMG SRC="../forward.gif"WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=3></A></BODY>
