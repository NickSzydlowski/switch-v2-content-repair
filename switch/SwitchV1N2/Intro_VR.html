It is accomplished through computer <BR><BR>simulation plus a bit of hallucination, and next <BR><BR>thing you realize, you are anywhere you wish to be. <BR><BR><BR>This leap in communication can be compared to the <BR><BR>introduction of the television in the 1940s. <BR><BR>Starting from a total of 5,000 t.v. sets in the U.S., <BR><BR>today you can find one (or more) in every home. <BR><BR>Virtual Reality (VR), also known as virtual <BR><BR>environments, simulation, or cyberspace, is as <BR><BR>far advanced as television was to radio. Critics <BR><BR>think there is nothing real about VR, but one <BR><BR>survey suggests it will eventually amount to more <BR><BR>than 60% of the market when its technology matures. <BR><BR><BR>Virtual Reality is defined in terms of telepresence <BR><BR>and depends on the perceiver. It is a medium for <BR><BR>the extension of the body and mind. It marks a <BR><BR>grand step for imagination, and aims to open up <BR><BR>physical boundaries. It could provide an interactive <BR><BR>experience rather than a passive one, one that takes <BR><BR>you to new worlds that have never before existed. <BLOCKQUOTE>Virtual Reality is electronic simulations <BR><BR>of environments experienced via head <BR><BR>mounted eye goggles and wired clothing <BR><BR>enabling the end user to interact in realistic <BR><BR>three-dimensional situations. <BR>(Coates, 1992)<BR><BR>Virtual Reality is an alternate world filled <BR><BR>with computer-generated images that respond <BR><BR>to human movements. These simulated environ- <BR><BR>ments are usually visited with the aid of an expen- <BR><BR>sive data suit which features stereophonic video <BR><BR>goggles and fiber-optic data gloves. <BR>(Krueger, 1991, p. xiii)</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>The media has created quite a public appetite for VR. <BR><BR>However, the technology is not yet ready to be implemented <BR><BR>at home. According to a woman who sampled one of the <BR><BR>better-known systems at a recent multimedia technology <BR><BR>show, &quot;It reminded me of a 3D video game. The images <BR><BR>were not very realistic.&quot; The less expensive systems have <BR><BR>crude graphics, and those with texture-mapped graphics <BR><BR>are too high-priced for the home market. <BR><BR><BR>What can VR provide for you? Like other media, VR will <BR><BR>let people conduct exchanges across time and space. It <BR><BR>will transmit both verbal and nonverbal messages, allowing <BR><BR>people in separate places to meet in another location. This <BR><BR>location is called &quot;cyberspace&quot;, a simulated environment <BR><BR>where simulated people can meet &quot;face-to-face&quot;. Eventually, <BR><BR>VR may have the ability to convey touch, allowing intimate <BR><BR>and powerful nonverbal communications. <BR><BR><BR>With society redefining itself in this information age, <BR><BR>people get to know each other and form bonds in multiple <BR><BR>ways and through a variety of media. Letters and <BR><BR>telephone calls become outdated as e-mail and video <BR><BR>conferencing take over. VR introduces yet another <BR><BR>new way for a personal encounter using the power of <BR><BR>a computer, rather than an airline. Of course you are <BR><BR>not physically sent to your rendezvous point, but if it <BR><BR>appears that you are, why not schedule Tahiti for your <BR><BR>next meeting? And if you're going to be in Tahiti, why <BR><BR>not simulate a great tan, and wear a pair of your favorite <BR><BR>sunglasses? What better way to attend your high school <BR><BR>reunion? How about trimming those extra pounds and <BR><BR>erasing that gray hair? The limits of presenting an image <BR><BR>will depend on your imagination. VR will supposedly give <BR><BR>you the means to transcend the real to create a communi- <BR><BR>cation environment that is hyper-real. <BR><BR><BR>Virtual reality, taken to its ideal, may then be providing <BR><BR>a communications environment where deception prevails. <BR><BR>People may portray fake self-images and thus, may mani- <BR><BR>pulate others' perceptions to achieve their own objective <BR><BR>in, say, a negotiation at hand. VR will allow people to <BR><BR>create and experience multidimensional messages that <BR><BR>act as &quot;reality&quot;. The power of expression could be <BR><BR>amplified. Actual face-to-face communication (not <BR><BR>through VR) may no longer be the most immediate form <BR><BR>of interpersonal communication since it may prove too <BR><BR>confining. Why meet face-to-face when I can schedule <BR><BR>the meeting through VR and change my image? <BR><BR><BR>Total freedom of expression can happen with VR. When it <BR><BR>is fully available, people might have the chance to ex- <BR><BR>perience sensory worlds indistinguishable from the real <BR><BR>world. Careful judgments will have to be made as to what <BR><BR>is real, and what is not. Information represented will be <BR><BR>a function of the observer's perception -- it is a constructed <BR><BR>reality. Reality studies indicate that in the past when a new <BR><BR>media has been introduced, people apply judgment processes <BR><BR>they already have. Initially, this has led to mistakes, even <BR><BR>funny ones, to which people adjust over time. The feeling <BR><BR>of being in another environment is at first likely to trigger <BR><BR>a broad range of involuntary emotional reactions similar to <BR><BR>those evoked by a frightening scene on television. Until we <BR><BR>adapt to VR's ability to make the fake seem much more real <BR><BR>than television, the reactions could be damaging. But studies <BR><BR>suggest that people will become accustomed to VR, with <BR><BR>responses that grow less intense. <BR><BR><BR>Although VR plans to bring a new &quot;reality&quot; into our worlds, I<BR><BR>am not convinced it will satisfy or deceive our senses. Our <BR><BR>innate biological needs cannot be replaced by a computerized <BR><BR>fantasy. Over three million years of human evolution cannot <BR><BR>be replaced by a keystroke. With all the required gear to wear, <BR><BR>I doubt we will feel the soft warmth of a blanket, the comfort <BR><BR>of a hug, the cool grass between our toes, or the rain on our faces. <BR><BR><BR><EM>(Author's note: For more detailed information on Virtual <BR><BR>Realty (VR), please refer to the outstanding book, <CITE>&quot;Commun- <BR><BR>ication in the Age of Virtual Reality&quot;</CITE>, edited by Frank <BR><BR>Biocca and Mark R.
