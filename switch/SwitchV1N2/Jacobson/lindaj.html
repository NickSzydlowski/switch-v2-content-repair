Would you talk a little bit about yourexperiences of the last 3 years, and what your current interest and involvementare in <A HREF="vrdef.html">virtual reality</A>?</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>The same year <CITE>Cyberarts </CITE>came out, I became involvedwith <CITE><A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/tcircus/Dcuckoo/">D'Cuckoo</A></CITE>.Now that's a musical group that does large-scale interactive multimediaperformance.</FONT> <BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>How were you involved?</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>My involvement was to help conceive, develop, and produce alarge interactive, multimedia, performance.</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>How would you describe D'Cuckoo?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>It's a neo-classical, post-industrial techno-tribal world funkensemble. In 1992 we opened up for the <CITE>Grateful Dead</CITE>. Alsoin 1992 I did some contract work for Xerox PARC, Palo Alto Research Center,documenting ubiquitous computing inventions. Also in 1992, I co-founded&quot;VERGE&quot; the Virtual Reality Education Foundation, an organizationdevoted to helping the general public understand VR technologies and applications.We put on events at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and present paneldiscussions, host guest speakers, and hold demonstrations.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>In 1993, I was involved in the launch of <CITE>Wired</CITE>magazine; I wrote my book, <CITE>Garage Virtual Reality</CITE>, and alsostarted performing with <CITE>D'Cuckoo</CITE> as the voice of a computer-generatedpuppet. I traveled around a lot in 1994 talking about garage VR. I alsowas involved in the launch of the magazine, <CITE>Computer Life</CITE>,and also joined the faculty of San Francisco State University in their multimediastudies program. In 1995 I've become involved in journalism on the Web andin writing for CD-ROM. And as of Monday (8/21/95), which I'm quite excitedabout, I will be working for Silicon Graphics, my job title being, Virtual Reality Evangelist. (lindaj@vrguru.asd.sgi.com)</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>In your preface to Cyberarts, you state that &quot;our industrializedsociety treats art as a product, and that because art is compartmentalizeda person has to choose to be a painter, a musician, a dancer, an actor ora designer.&quot; You go on to point out that computers have made it possibleto &quot;let us soar beyond such self-imposed boundaries.&quot;</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>In the past 25 years, social movements (feminism, civil rights,gay and lesbian liberation and multiculturalism) have challenged the dominantwhite, patriarchal order in American society. As virtual reality becomesmore pervasive in our society, its potential for empowering people to createand; choose their own identity and move outside the boundaries imposed byself and society becomes more conceivable. Issues of identity and body politicshave been widely debated and have been a strong postmodernist focus in theart world for the past 10 years. <BR><H4><CENTER><IMG SRC="LJACOB.gif" WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=153 CENECASCALEIMAGE=0 ALIGN=bottom><EM>Image by LLL<BR></CENTER></EM></H4>What role do you think VR will take in the discourse and social evolutionof identity and body politics?</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>In order to answer this question we really need to understandwhat VR is. Fundamentally, it's a computer- human interface; it's a differentway to look at the computer. As we look at the evolution of computers, thetechnology has been dominated by white patriarchy -- it's a technology.One very forward thinking white man, Jaron Lanier who popularized the termVR, put forth the notion that we can leave our bodies and explore new identities.His famous example is that you could be a lobster in VR interacting withother lobsters. Jaron is an artist first and foremost, and that brings akey issue in -- and that is to involve artists in the discourse and developmentof VR to help us in the realization of our dreams, and assist in the evolutionof identity. <BR><BR>Before that can happen, the technology has to evolve enough for artiststo get a hold on it. One ground- breaking work was <CITE>Placeholder</CITE>-- developed by Brenda Laurel, Rob Tow, and Rachel Strickland -- all ofInterval Research. That was a system that allowed people to explore identity,including physical identity, in a natural setting based on the CanadianRockies. That system cost over a million dollars to implement.</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>So it wasn't very widespread?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Not at all. A few hundred people experienced it and then itwas dismantled.</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>This was an artwork?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>It was an artwork - absolutely. All the artwork that has beendone with VR has been made possible thanks to companies who are workingwith artists and supporting their ideas. Of course, they can't support everyone,and that's one reason I've been promulgating low-cost VR -- so that artistscan get involved.</FONT> <BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Virtual reality is a transitory reality. Judith Butler writesin <CITE>Gender Trouble</CITE>, &quot;Gender ought not be constructed asa stable identity as locus of agency from which arious acts follows; rathergender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exteriorspace through a stylized repetition of acts.&quot;<BR><BR>Do you think VR will serve to make more evident the subjective and transitorynature of identity?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Only if people create VR environments that allow people toexperience that.</FONT> <BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Will the perceived necessity to define gender become unimportant?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>It's all how we raise our children. It's not about VR, itsup to the parents to give them notions about the lack of limitations ofgender. Do you see this leading to experiences of <A HREF="body.html">disembodiment</A>?<BR><BR>That's where VR is right now. In most virtual worlds you exist as a hand.In one arcade game, you are a gun, reacting with cartoon characters. Anotherarcade game allows you to be a pool ball on a pool table. You are totallydisembodied, and have the experience of being a cue ball. </FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>In her essay, <CITE>The Seduction of Cyberspace</CITE>, N.Katherine Hayles discusses &quot;The Mirror of the Cyborg,&quot; dynamicallydifferent from the Lacanian mirror, as signification goes beyond languageand is opened up by a fuller range of sensory feedback in cyberspace. Shewrites,</FONT> <BLOCKQUOTE>Cyberspace represents a powerful challenge to the customaryconstruction of the body's boundaries, opening them to transformative configurationsthat always bear the trace of the other. The resulting disorientation canfunction as a wedge to destabilize presuppostions about self and other.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Does VR have the potential for perhaps creating a simultaneousexperience of otherness and self?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Definitely. These questions are beautiful, but again, it alldepends upon what people do with VR.</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>So it's totally up the creators of virtual reality?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Definitely.</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>With economic barriers of virtual reality, how much of the&quot;other&quot; in terms of race, class, and gender difference is currentlyparticipating in VR?</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Those involved in developing VR are mostly white, mostly male,mostly middle- and upper-class people. They're not the kind of people interestedin asking questions. They are fine-with-who-they-are-already-thank-you-very-much!</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>The only way to get a VR experience if you're not behind thescenes in development, is to pay a buck a minute at an arcade -- right offthe bat you're not going to allow certain people the experience just basedon the cost alone. And then there's the whole arcade environment and women.It's very male. The arcade game-scene is really lopsided in this respect.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>It seems more women have to get involved.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Yeah, you bet!</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>What do you think the social implications could be in a postcolonial,global society?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Again, it really all depends on the developers and creatorsof VR.</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Substantial effort is going into the creation of virtual realitytools while much less thought and importance is given to the significant,social, cultural and political changes VR technology could engender. PeterDrucker in his book, <CITE>Post Capitalist Society</CITE>, comments that&quot;technology itself matters less than the changes it triggers.&quot;<BR><BR>Morton Heilig, who has been working with the ideas of virtual reality for40 years states in Cyberarts that the technological evolution of our societyhas left us sensorially deprived; we have sterilized our environments, physicallyas well as emotionally. He sees the burgeoning of virtual reality technologyas a response to this loss of basic human experience, that we realize weneed more than the industrial revolution and the information revolution.He predicts an &quot;experiential revolution&quot; where virtual realitywill be a significant component. <BR><BR>In regard to this &quot;experiential revolution&quot; Heilig says: Ultimately,the country that comes up with what I call &quot;experiential power,&quot;sensorial power, emotional power, will emerge as the dominant culture. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>You cited my most favorite essay in the whole book. Here it'simportant to put Heilig in the context of his time, when he put forth thenotion of the &quot;experiential revolution.&quot; This came about duringthe cold war, he was a beatnik, cinematographer, a filmmaker, and a videographer.If you take his words, &quot;sensorial power,&quot; and &quot;emotionalpower&quot;; and substitute&quot;Hollywood,&quot; you've got the currentstatus quo. It is the U.S. that is the dominant culture today because ofthe sensorial and emotional power wielded by Hollywood.<BR><BR>It was true then, and he was hoping and working toward the U.S. becomingan experiential power. He was way ahead of his time, and Hollywood did notgrok the experiential idea.</FONT> <BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Can you comment on Heilig's view in terms of present commercialapplications of VR, the realm where most people are likely to experiencevirtual reality, and where the competitive and aggressive model is the norm?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>The realm where most people are likely to explore the experientialwas not the movies -- Heilig wasn't able to sell his ideas to the moviemakers.His work<A HREF="sensor.html"> &quot;Sensorama,&quot; </A>wound up in gamearcades. Also, ironically or not, back then game arcades were where peopletried their hand at pinball and skeeball -- games of skill and chance. Todaythe game arcade is the place where most people are likely to experienceVR. But, it's characterized by competition and aggression rather than skilland chance and whimsy and pleasure and discovery.</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Does Heilig's view fit the collaborative space model, whereall players contribute, but no one can dominate? How would his predictioninfluence choices of identity as technology continues to evolve?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>We might look at this question differently if we come to Heiligunderstanding him in terms of Hollywood. It's not a collaborative modelbut a theatrical model where there is an audience and performers, and allof the senses on the part of the audience are involved in experiencing theperformer. <A HREF="../Laurel_interv/Laurel_intro.html">Brenda Laurel</A>wrote a book in 1992, <CITE>Computers as Theatre</CITE>, that gets intothe real interesting theatrical work -- about using the computer as a performancespace and allowing the audience to take part in the creation of the performance.And that puts a spin on Heilig's ideas that can really, really allow usto play around with our choices of identity.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>What is real important to me is the notion that everybody isan artist. Sure, some people are born with more innate talent than others,but everyone is able to express ideas and emotions artistically. It's importantto me that VR attain its lofty status as an artist's tool, an artistic medium,one that will allow the viewer or participant to become co-creator in theart. That alone affects our self identity. With VR you're no longer justa consumer.</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Do you envision this more in the future than now?</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>In the near future. But that's what <CITE>D'Cuckoo</CITE> istrying to do -- give the audience new ways to react with graphics and sound.</FONT><BR><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>Do you have any comments in conclusion?</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Off the record -- well, on the record, I loved these questions.Did you come up with them? </FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>In conjunction with Geri Wittig; she gave me a lot of input.</FONT><BR><BR>W<FONT SIZE=4>ell, they were great. They made me look at the current situationof VR and feel rather frustrated! I think its really important what you'redoing and that <CITE>Switch</CITE> be globally experienced -- that theseideas get spread around. This is the most fun I've had doing an interview.Thanks!</FONT> <HR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A></BODY>
