It is a semi-portable automatic machine thatcan be plugged in anywhere electricity is available. The illusion of realityis achieved by providing the viewer with a wide range of sensory information.All of this information is perfectly synchronized with the picture (aromas,wind, and vibrations change instantly). All the control information is onone piece of film. Sensorama is completely automatic. The viewer activatesit by depositing a coin or pushing a button (depending on application).&quot;</FONT></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=3>-Morton Heilig, 1961</FONT><HR> <BR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0><BR><BR></A><A HREF="lindaj.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A></BODY>
