A successful VR appplication delivers both quality contentand experience; thus, virtual reality essentially represents an evolutionof user interface studies and human factors-based application design.<BR><BR>The use of goggles, gloves, and or full-body datasuits represents one ofthe three major VR implementations, or delivery environments. This implementationis called &quot;immersive&quot; or &quot;inclusive&quot; VR because theparticipant feels as if he or she is inside the graphic, or virtual, world.<BR><BR>The second type of VR implementation is called &quot;desktop VR.&quot; Itinvolves viewing the 3D world through a &quot;window&quot; on a stereo viewingmonitor or on a screen inside a simulator cab. The participant &quot;steers&quot;through the virtual world using physical controls provided by special 3Ddata input devices.<BR><BR>The third type of implementation is &quot;third-person,&quot; in which youview and steer an image of yourself interacting in the virtual world (thisis the type of implementation used in Myron Krueger's VIDEOPLACE and VividEffects' Mandala System -- also the approach used by a TV weatherman whenhe looks off-screen to see his image superimposed on an image of the weathermap). In VR applications, this implementation often involves a theatricalsort of set-up that incorporates a viewing stage, video monitors nad projectors,performance animation, and video imaging.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A><A HREF="lindaj.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif"WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A></BODY>
