<HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY BACKGROUND="../paper1.gif"><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>These <A HREF="consid.html">considerations</A> open out ontoa vastfield of recent critical theory concerning the body and its relationshipwith gender, technology, and the mind. My own focus has been on the waythe cartesian mind/body duality has been articulated in computer technologyand particulary in VR... <BR><BR>In 1990, when VR had just burst out of the labs into popular culture, Ibegan to examine some of the rhetorical claims concerning &quot;the body&quot;in VR. It has been claimed that VR is a liberation from the Cartesian mind-bodyduality. This would be a marvelous thing if it were true, as neurologicaland physiological research over the last fifty years seems to indicate thatsuch a distinction cannot be substantiated. The mind-body split is, at best,a philosophical convenience and, at worst, completely wrong. The notionof a body (virtual or real) &quot;driven&quot; by mind like some kind ofteleoperated robot, an obedient servant, is a basic tenant of nineteenth-centuryindustrialism: the bosses and the workers. To me, VR seems to blithely reconstitutea mind/body split that is essentially patriarchal and industrialist.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=3>-Simon Penny, from<CITE> Consumer Culture and the TechnologicalImperative</CITE></FONT><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="../switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A><BR><BR><A HREF="lindaj.html"><IMG SRC="../backward.gif" WIDTH=90 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A></BODY>
