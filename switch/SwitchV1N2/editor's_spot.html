<HEAD>    <TITLE>Switch: Editor's Spot</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=#cfd1a2><H1><BR>SWITCH On<BR>Virtual Reality</H1><HR SIZE=8 ALIGN=left><BR><BR>Welcome to our second issue of Switch. This time we focus on Virtual Reality,with its seductive promise of three-dimensional immersive environments.The desire for multiple convincing worlds available at a command comes froman imagination desiring to escape the limits of the everyday world. We wantto explore a simulated fantasyland and replace for a time the difficultone we know. <BR><BR>Two interviews, <A HREF="Laurel_interv/Laurel_intro.html"><STRONG>JasonChallas</STRONG> speaking with <STRONG>Brenda Laurel</STRONG></A>, and <A HREF="Jacobson/body.html"><STRONG>LorettaL. Lange</STRONG> with <STRONG>Linda Jacobson</STRONG></A>, both touch onthe issue of identity in VR, theorizing whether one can escape entirelyinto another existence. If VR were to reach its full potential, then onecould &quot;become&quot; someone of the opposite sex, of an altered gender,or of another race. Each of them considers whether this would alter ourconsciousness or our political perceptions.<BR><BR>The film industry has the highest need for depicting alternate realities,transporting the viewer into the realm of the &quot;Other.&quot; <STRONG><A HREF="Virtualcell.html">Asil</A></STRONG> takes a look at several films that picture our worldre-shaped by computer VR technology. <BR><BR>All of these issues depend on the performance of actual VR clothing, suchas goggles and gloves. <A HREF="PDQ/VRware_intro.html"><STRONG>P.D. Quick</STRONG>examines the current state of <STRONG>VR-ware</STRONG></A> in evidence atSIGGRAPH '95 this past August. His research challenges the prevailing conceptionthat fully accessible VR lies just around the corner.<BR><BR>Our new <STRONG>Project Page</STRONG>, under construction, will offer aVRML viewpoint for this issue, with information on vrml browsers. The estimatedcompletion date is November 15, 1995.<BR><BR>Before you leave our site, check out our <A HREF="cal/cal.html"><STRONG>calendarsection</STRONG> edited by <STRONG>Erika Ismerio</STRONG></A>, with a fulllisting of events, exhibitions and competitions. <BR><BR>We have also added a new page of links to places we've found concerningVR, our <STRONG><A HREF="PDQ/gateway.html">Switch Gateway</A></STRONG>.<BR><BR>Let us know if you have comments, additions, or corrections to our publishedinformation. You can reach us at 70451.1665@Compuserve.com.<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><A HREF="tocV1N2.html"><IMG SRC="switch.gif" WIDTH=108 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=middle CENECASCALEIMAGE=0></A>  is the electronic arts journal of the C.A.D.R.E.Institute <BR><BR>in San Jose, California. We are interested in fostering a critical viewpointon issues and developments wherever crossovers occur between art and technology.In order to do this we rely largely on the written word. Our main articlesfocus on some aspect of computer-related technology... the San FranciscoBay Area but we would also hope to generate or encourage collaboration withothers who are working and thinking about similar issues through communicationinlets such as e-mail and teleconferencing. <BR><BR></BODY>
