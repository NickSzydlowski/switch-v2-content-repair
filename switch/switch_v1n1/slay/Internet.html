<P>
CL:  Does the issue of <STRONG><A HREF="surveillance.html">surveillance</A></STRONG> actually bring you to a discussion of the Internet?
<BR>SLAYTON:  Definitely.<q-3>  One of the problems with the Internet centers around the motivation for establishing it, meaning that there still is a centralized, authoritarian approach.</q-3>  The government says "we want industry to build the information superhighway."  We want to stop and question why that is.<q6><q9>  Of course they have the resources, but they will only set it up because it's profitable.</q9></q6>  It's seen as a commerce and therefore has to be regulated, has to be handled just like everything else in our lives.<q8><q5><q1>  The issue is accessibility of information, the collection of records and how those things are shared.</q1></q5></q8>  All this needs close examination by artists who work on the Internet and produce <STRONG><A HREF="art.html">art</A></STRONG>.
<P>

<A NAME="contrl">CL:   Who controls the Internet?</A>
<BR>SLAYTON:  First of all, the Internet is just a way of moving <A HREF="surveillance.html#common">information</A> around.  It originally developed as universities exchanged information with one another and then industry got involved and the pipelines and conduits became the Internet.<q1><q5>  It's a standarized protocol for how that gets done.</q5></q1><q6><q4>  Initially it occurred without an autocratic point of view.</q4></q6>  Now government and industry have realized the importance of <STRONG><A HREF="control.html">control</A></STRONG> and they are attempting to re-structure the Internet.<q7><q4>  The struggle is just beginning.</q4></q7>
<q6><q2><q5><q4>
<P>
CL:  Do artists access the Internet through universities?
<BR>SLAYTON:  Not necessarily.  They can access it through universities, commerical services, non-profit services, or whatever.  Again, <STRONG><A HREF="art.html">art</A></STRONG>ists are kind of <nano-technology#late>come-late-to-the-scene individuals and the Internet's been around for a while, it's not a new thing.</q4></q5></q2></q6>  It's only recently that it's become so popularized.
