CL:  The computer artist becomes a master of language?
<BR>SLAYTON:  If you want to make something happen with the computer you have to express it in formal language.  <A HREF="art.html">Artists</A>, as it turns out, have really amazing programming abilities.<q-3><q8><q4>  Musicians and artists are really good at it.  It's like composition, not really all that different from what we do naturally -- the process is very artistic.</q4></q8>
<P>
CL:  What's unique about an artist who's also a programmer Ð is it the way he or she thinks, or is it the purpose that they choose?
<BR>SLAYTON:  I think the two go hand in hand.  The artist working with a computer first has to think of some reason to work with a computer.  You have to have something to do with it and then you have to be able to do it with it.<q7><q8>  You know, this is kind of where it breaks down.  The students who are too job-oriented, this is the part that they don't really want to know about.  They're unaware of a kind of <STRONG><A HREF="appliances.html">conceptual</A></STRONG>, theoretical understanding of computers and <STRONG><A HREF="information.html">information theory</A></STRONG>.  They don't see that it's part of the picture and that as an <STRONG><A HREF="art.html">artist</A></STRONG> you have to have that repertoire of knowledge.
<P>
CL:  You mean they just want to sit down and make pretty pictures?
<BR>SLAYTON:  They want to do whatever the machine tells them is okay to do.  That's why everything looks the way it does.</q-3></q8></q7>  So getting<q-3> back</q-3> to this idea of the kind of essence that the computer is.  The computer processes symbolic information literally<q-1><q-4>.  That's what it does.  And it doesn't process math, it's not a big calculator.  It processes symbolic information</q-4></q-1> that is expressed to it in language.  The wonderful thing about it is that you can <A HREF="DoWhatDo.html#express">express ideas to it</A> and have those ideas actuated, compiled and given form.  That's pretty amazing, for any machine to do something that incredible is amazing.
