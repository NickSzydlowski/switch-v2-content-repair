CL:  So <STRONG><A HREF="CADRE.html">CADRE</A></STRONG> students will explore many aspects of <STRONG><A HREF="technology.html">technology</A></STRONG> as art media, using the computer as the main tool.  How do you approach making art with the computer -- what is the actual medium manipulated by the artist?
<BR>SLAYTON:  To begin with, the computer's not a tool -- it's more than a tool.<q-3>  It's like no other contraption in the world!<q6>  Tools in the traditional sense extend your prosthetic domain, your physical control over the environment.</q6>  Whether it's a shovel or a hammer or a telescope or whatever. </q-3> But computers don't have a purpose until it has been described to them.  A lot of people call them universal machines, since they can be transformed into any machine that you want them to behave like.<q-3><q-2>
<P>
CL:  You can turn it into a hammer if you want to?
<BR>SLAYTON:  You could.  And we've done that...!  Or other things -- like <A HREF="technology.html#performance">performance</A>.  Computers are everywhere.  They're just buried in every interaction that we undertake during the course of the day.  They're pretty transparent, actually.</q-2></q-3>  People get it in their mind that a computer is only about this thing that sits on a table and puts an image on a screen.  They miss the entire potential of what's possible.<q-3>  An artist working with the computer <q-2>has to</q-2><q2>should</q2> see it as a <STRONG><A HREF="appliances.html">conceptual</A></STRONG> machine.  It's a conceptual medium, and you have to work with language to make it become what you want it to become.  If there's a medium in the computer it's <STRONG><A HREF="language.html">language</A></STRONG><q9><q1>, not hardware</q1></q9>.
<P>
<A NAME="master">CL:  Do you think you could become a master of this medium?</A>
<BR>SLAYTON:  Oh yes.  It might take years, but a <STRONG><A HREF="collabor.html">collaborative</A></STRONG> model like DoWhatDo has the potential of becoming a whole art movement with all the dimensions of success or failure!</q-3><q-2><q-1>  You know, like Dada Ð <STRONG><A HREF="DoWhatDo.html">DoWhatDo</A></STRONG>...  It should be in everyone's vocabulary and part of art everywhere, like theory and criticism.  I'd like to see it become mainstream.</q-1></q-2>  It would make things so much more interesting.  <q-1><q-6>Otherwise life is all too <A HREF="technology.html">predictable</A></A>.</q-6></q-1>
