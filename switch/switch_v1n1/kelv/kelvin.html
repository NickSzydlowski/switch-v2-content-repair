    <P>The purpose of the "Hoover" project is to provide users

    <P> an opportunity to view and assimilate the multi-cultural
		
		<P>establishments of private residences over the internet.
		
		<P>This will be accomplished with the concept of telepresence. 
		
		<P>Telepresence is defined as the ability for a user to experience

    <P>a remote environment using a probe that provides audio and 

		<P>visual information back to the user.  Traditionally, telepresence 
		
		<P>probes are used for job efficiency, to interact with hazardous
		
		<P>environments, and to experience environments inaccessible to 
		
		<P>humans.  The "Hoover" Project will provide an extension to
		
		<P>the traditional use of telepresence.  This mobile probe will be 
		
		<P>installed in residential homes to view the intimate lifestyles
		
		<P>of several residences in Silicon Valley.  The public is viewers 
		
		<P>who have access to the internet.  All information will be gathered,

		<P>processed, documented, synthesized, and statistically analyzed
		
		<P>for abnormalities.
		

		<P><BR>The implication of this project relates to information privacy
		
		<P>and Big Brotherism.  We are in a society consistently monitored by
		
		<P>forms of electronic surveillance.  For example, credit ratings may
		
		<P>describe a person as likely to commit treason; computer monitoring

		<P>may statistically decide a person is likely to be a serial killer; in
		
		<P>addition, internet surveillance will provide a vast amount of  
		
		<P>information on a person's intimate lifestyle.  Agencies are now 

		<P>quantifying this information to suggest a person's likeliness to
		
		<P>commit potential criminal activities.  How easy it would be for  
		
		<P>computers to make moral decisions.
 
		
		<P><BR>From a technical point of view, a mobile probe will be
		
		<P>designed and constructed to carry a video camera and a  
		
		<P>microphone.  All video and audio information will be transmitted

		<P>wireless to a base computer workstation.  This information will

		<P>then be transferred on-the-fly to a World Wide Web page, and it 
		
		<P>will be <A HREF=http://cadre.sjsu.edu/info/personell/chan/hoover.html>accessible</A> via the internet.  The user will have the ability 
		
		<P>to view video and audio information over the internet and be able
		
		<P>to control the probe using "Netscape", a public domain browser.
