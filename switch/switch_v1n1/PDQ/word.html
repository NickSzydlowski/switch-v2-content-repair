The word association "incite insight," as depicted above, has become one of PDQ's trademarks.  The literal meaning reads "PDQ says incite insight," with PDQ as an indeterminant and the word "says" as  a vocal verb.  A metaphoric reading is that the  words 'incite' and 'insight' have the same vocal meaning but different literal meanings.  Lastly, the allegorical reading becomes a layering of the literal meaning and the metaphoric meaning.</center></center>
