The understanding of words uttered by PDQ (a floating television media head) are contingent upon their contextual association to either Doug or PDQ.  As a floating media head it is difficult to be sympathetic to PDQ, but if PDQ is understood as a medium through which <a href="doug.html">Doug</a> speaks, its contextual interpretation is quite different.
