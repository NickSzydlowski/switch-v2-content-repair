<center>One of PDQ's vignettes takes the form of an insightful recapitulation of the gay experience in American suburbia.  The sensitivity and detail of the depiction leads one to believe that its description comes from experience.  Since PDQ as living entity exists only as a floating Media head, it becomes apparent that these experiences do not come from PDQ and must have been experienced by Patrick Douglas Quick (Doug).  Here it seems the puppeteer speaks through the puppet. </center><br><p>
