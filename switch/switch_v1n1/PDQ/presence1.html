PDQ's interactive presence challenges the traditional relationship of artist to art object or performer to performance.  PDQ's active presence defies traditional modes of representation.  It is not a  signifier locked into the role of the performance and it is not a live performer per se.  The relationship between Doug (Patrick Douglas Quick) and PDQ, like that of the puppeteer to the puppet, becomes contextually indefinable one from the other.  PDQ speaks through Doug's mouth and Doug speaks through PDQ.  The performance and performer become indefinable as such.<p>
