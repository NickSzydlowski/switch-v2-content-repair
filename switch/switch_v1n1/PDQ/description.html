PDQ  takes the form of a floating media-generated head, a projected presence emanating from within a television screen.  Unlike traditional video media PDQ has a live interactive presence (Patrick Douglas Quick), and is informed via hidden video cameras such that he can see what is going on in the performance space.  A video camera simultaneously records Doug as the floating head and Doug, through the hidden camera, responds to circumstances within the performance space creating a live interactive media <a href="presence1.html">presence.</a>   The format of PDQ takes place within a series of vignettes, which are back-dropped by seemingly nonsensical word associations. </center></h1>
