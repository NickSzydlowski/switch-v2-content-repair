<TITLE>Tribe</TITLE>


		<P>Emerging digital and telecommunication technologies 
		
		<P>are redefining fundamental concepts in our culture.  
		
		<P>Ideas of time, space, and community will have a 
		
		<P>different meaning from now on.



		<P><BR>We will belong to different types of tribes in the 
		
		<P>future, and some of them will be unlike anything we've 
		
		<P>ever experienced before.



		<P><BR>The tribe that we call the Web has yet to reveal its 
		
		<P>ultimate shape and dimension.  But what intrigues me about 
		
		<P>this <A HREF="gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/11/Community">community</A> is not so much how different it is from my 
		
		<P>own physical neighborhood, but rather how similar they are.



		<P><BR>People bring to the Web the same needs, the same thought 
		
		<P>patterns, the same questions that one finds in any tribe:  
		
		<P><A HREF="http://yri.iu.net/Renewal/Testimonies/testimonies.html">Testimonies</A> of faith, questions about <A HREF="http://avalon.syr.edu/ChiAlpha/god.html">god</A>, the meaning of 
		
		<P><A HREF="http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/lexicon.html">dreams</A>, sex and <A HREF="http://www.ag.com/Condom/Country">commerce</A>, a longing for <A HREF="http://welcomehome.org/rainbow.html">home</A>.



		<P><BR>This is very good news for artists, because it means there's 
		
		<P>work for us here.  The tribe needs us.  



		<P><BR>The fact that the Web is terribly thin on content, and riddled 
		
		<P>with horrible design, shouldn't be discouraging.  It means that 
		
		<P>those of us who have arrived early have an amazing opportunity 
		
		<P>to actually construct this new territory.



		<P><BR>I'm perfectly aware that the Web may follow the same trajectory 
		
		<P>as television, and may ultimately cater to the same brain-dead 
		
		<P>demographic midrange.  But I believe there are alternatives to 
		
		<P>this, and that artists can potentially be key players in pre-
		
		<P>venting such an evolution.



		<P><BR>We can accomplish this by creating content-rich work that con-
		
		<P>tinues to articulate basic human concerns; which is, of course, 
		
		<P>what artists have always done.



		<P><BR>But we need to learn to speak differently.  The answer lies in 
		
		<P>shedding old baggage like the art as object bias, and replacing 
		
		<P>it with something like the idea of art as signal.



		<P><BR>The Web is characterized by experiences that are transitory, 
		
		<P>multi-layered, non-linear, and immaterial.  This is the language 
		
		<P>that the tribes of the Web speak.  And for the Web artists of the 
		
		<P>future, it will be their native tongue.
