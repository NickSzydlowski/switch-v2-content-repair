<TITLE>Fascinated</TITLE>


		<P>I can create work in the Web that I could 
		
		<P>never have conceived of in another medium.
		
		

		<P><BR>I've learned this slowly, and I haven't 
		
		<P>learned it by thinking it through, either.  
		
		
		
		<P><BR>Like all the artwork I've ever done, 
		
		<P>I've learned by doing.



		<P><BR>The first piece I ever created for the Web 
		
		<P>was titled <I><A HREF="http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/ludgate/the/place/place2.html">Life With Father</A></I>.  
		
		<P>It chronicles my relationship with my father, 
		
		<P>and is organized in a linear fashion.  
		
		<P>This piece would not be significantly different 
		
		<P>had I produced it as a traditional book.  
		
		
		
		<P><BR>The Web gave me an opportunity to integrate 
		
		<P>a group of  text and visual material in a manner 
		
		<P>that was new for me.  
		
		
		
		<P><BR>But given my total lack of prior experience 
		
		<P>with the medium, I just wasn't ready to explore 
		
		<P>much beyond familiar territory.



		<P><BR>With my second and most recent piece, 
		
		<P>titled <I><A HREF="http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/ludgate/urban_diary/intro.html">Urban Diary</A></I>, I feel as though 
		
		<P>I've finally gotten a toehold on just what
		
		<P>the Web might offer me as an artistic medium.  
		
		<P>This piece could never be created on the 
		
		<P>walls of a gallery, or in the pages of a book.
		
		
		
		<P><BR>I still feel good about "Life With Father", 
		
		<P>but it also reminds me of the baggage that 
		
		<P>I tend to bring to any new medium.
		
		

		<P><BR>I have a very traditional training as an artist, 
		
		<P>or so it seems to me now in hindsight.  
		
		<P>Working on the Web has made me aware of many 
		
		<P>of the assumptions that I bring to artmaking.  
		
		<P>And those assumptions have proven to be the biggest 
		
		<P>obstacles in truly exploiting the inherent 
		
		<P>qualities of the Web.  
		
	
	
		<P><BR>The artworld is predicated on a number of 
		
		<P>beliefs that do not accomodate electronic 
		
		<P>art in general and Web-based art in particular.



		<P><BR>The most obvious of these is the almost universal 
		
		<P>assumption that artists make objects that are 
		
		<P>unique, precious, and valuable.  



		<P><BR>Museums owe their existence to this belief, and 
		
		<P>we all know that it's the life-blood of the 
		
		<P>current gallery economy.  Art schools, because 
		
		<P>they feed these institutional mechanisms, also 
		
		<P>tend to produce young artists heavily invested 
		
		<P>in these beliefs.



		<P><BR>But dragging these beliefs onto the Web is like 
		
		<P>trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.  
		
		<P>It just doesn't work.  And the reason it doesn't 
		
		<P>work is that this attitude denies the very aspects 
		
		<P>of the Web that make it different from other media.
