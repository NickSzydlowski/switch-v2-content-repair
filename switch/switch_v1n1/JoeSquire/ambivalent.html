<TITLE>Ambivalent</TITLE>


		<P>I don't want to be an evangelist for computer 
		
		<P>technology.  I like my computer about as much 
		
		<P>as I like my car and my telephone; meaning that 
		
		<P>I don't care for it all that much.



		<P><BR>Viewing artwork on a computer isn't like standing 
		
		<P>in front of a painting.  There are qualitative 
		
		<P>differences that shouldn't be obscured.  I don't 
		
		<P>believe, as others have suggested, that elec-
		
		<P>tronic art will make more traditional art 
		
		<P>practices obsolete.



		<P><BR>Sometimes I'm surprised by the fact that I even own 
		
		<P>a computer, let alone that I make art for the Web.  
		
		<P>After all, I grow an organic garden every summer.   
		
		<P>My vision of the idyllic vacation is a 10-day solo 
		
		<P>backpacking trip in the Sierras.  I take long walks 
		
		<P>in my neighborhood, and make a point of talking to 
		
		<P>my neighbors.  In other words, I'm very tied to the 
		
		<P>material world and my local surroundings.



		<P><BR>But I'm also aware that I live in a house with indoor 
		
		<P>plumbing and central heating; not a hut in the woods.  
		
		<P>And I have to confess that some nights I call in my 
		
		<P>pizza order, pick it up at the drive-thru window, and 
		
		<P>motor home to watch a rented video.



		<P><BR>In other words, technology plays a big part in my life, 
		
		<P>and I derive some significant benefits from it.  I just 
		
		<P>try to keep a balanced perspective, and not be seduced 
		
		<P>by the hype.



		<P><BR>And so it is with the Web.  I've met people I never would 
		
		<P>have known, and I have a worldwide audience for my work.  
		
		<P>But I still talk to my neighbors.  And it's still important 
		
		<P>that I buy one of those awful chocolate bars from the kid 
		
		<P>next door who's raising money for his school band.
