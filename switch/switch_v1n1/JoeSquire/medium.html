<TITLE>Medium</TITLE>



		<P>The Web wasn't envisioned as an artistic medium.  
		
		<P>But then, neither was photography, film, or video.  



		<P><BR>The Niepce brothers, who are credited with creating 
		
		<P>the first photograph, didn't set out to make art. 
		
		<P>They were trying to sell more newspapers.  Daguerre, 
		
		<P>another pioneer in photography, wasn't looking for 
		
		<P>salvation; he was trying to make a buck.  Edweard 
		
		<P>Muybridge's early experiments in film were motivated 
		
		<P>by scientific inquiry, not by aesthetic contemplation.



		<P><BR>Many of the new artistic media of the last 150 years 
		
		<P>have their roots in industry and capitalism.  Although 
		
		<P>it may not appeal to many artists working in these media, 
		
		<P>the truth is that they are all disciples of the techno-
		
		<P>cratic machine aesthetic.  It's just that the romantics 
		
		<P>and the visionaries fell in behind the industrial apparatus 
		
		<P>and bent these media to purposes for which they were not 
		
		<P>originally intended.



		<P><BR>There are some uncanny parallels in the development of the 
		
		<P>Web, except that there's the added intrigue of its genesis 
		
		<P>in the military warfare culture.



		<P><BR>But just as photography, film, and video were eventually 
		
		<P>embraced by artists as new expressive languages, artists may 
		
		<P>discover that the Web provides them with new ways of speaking 
		
		<P>and new audiences.



		<P><BR>This will prove particularly valuable for artists interested 
		
		<P>in appropriating the languages of popular culture. After all, 
		
		<P>that's what photography, film, video, and now electronic art 
		
		<P>all share in common; the fact that these languages are part of 
		
		<P>everyday discourse for practically every member of the tribe.  
		
		<P>And this relationship to the culture at large is also what 
		
		<P>separates these media from the more traditional practices of 
		
		<P>painting and sculpture, which have more elitist pretensions 
		
		<P>and engage a dwindling constituency.
