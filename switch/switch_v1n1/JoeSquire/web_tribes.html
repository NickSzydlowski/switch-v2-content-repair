    <P ALIGN="indent">I'm <A HREF="fascinated.html">fascinated</A> by the Web, but also profoundly

   <P><A HREF="ambivalent.html">ambivalent</A>. Don't let anybody fool you into
		
		<P>believing that the Internet is everything it's 
		
		<P>hyped as.  And don't be fooled into thinking 
		
		<P>that its a place brimming with incredible <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Art/">art</A>.



    <P><BR>It isn't.



		<P><BR>The Web, which is the Internet at its best, is 
		
		<P>an awkward and clunky environment for an artist 
		
		<P>to work in.  The design possibilities are 
		
		<P>excruciatingly limited.   Images load slowly
		
		<P>under even the best of circumstances.  And it 
		
		<P>can get frustrating if you don't particularly 
		
		<P>like watching video the size of a postage stamp, 
		
		<P>or listening to sound in 20 second increments.



		<P><BR>But still, I'm drawn to the Web and have even 
		
		<P>committed myself to working in it as my chosen 
		
		<P><A HREF="medium.html">medium</A>.  I'm not so much interested in what the 
		
		<P>Web is, but rather in what it can become. I'm 
		
		<P>particularly curious about how artists will 
		
		<P>work here.



		<P><BR>Independent of medium or tool or technique, 
		
		<P>there are timeless aspects of art that endure.  
		
		<P>Artists communicate.  



		<P><BR>They accomplish this by speaking a symbolic
		
		<P>language that is shared by the tribe.  The Web 
		
		<P>is a very unusual kind of <A HREF="tribe.html">tribe</A>, but the word fits.  
		
		<P>And like all tribes before it, there will be those 
		
		<P>who give expression to the beliefs and values 
		
		<P>of the group.


		<P><BR>They'll call themselves artists.



		<P><BR>The language they will use won't look or feel like 
		
		<P>anything that we've experienced before.  I don't know 
		
		<P>what the exact shape of that language will be.  It's
		
		<P>beyond my ability to imagine.  But I know that I'm
		
		<P>witnessing its beginning.
