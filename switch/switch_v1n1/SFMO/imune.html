<q4><q5><q6>Immunity from the <STRONG><A HREF="reality.html">reality</A></STRONG> of images is a theme of Gerhard Richter's <STRONG><A HREF="andAndyWarhol%27s.html">and 
Andy Warhol's</A></STRONG> work. Richter appropriates images from the mass media, in other words, he reads the paper and then cuts out his favorite pictures.  These images are then translated into very slick paintings which by the removal of them from the context of the news media lose their meaning.  As if they ever had a meaning.  I think this is what he is trying to point to in a very puzzling manner.  An example of this would be his painting of the Eight Student Nurses.  They were black and white painting, 30" x 40" , out of focus, with the  look and feel of year book pictures of the 1950s to 1960s.  "Most significant, they are generally painted out of focus.  As Richter has noted, paint on canvas cannot be unsharp.  And indeed, the unsettling aspect of these works is the way in which they fluctuate between the visual conventions of the two images.  Their composition, subject matter, and blurred, momentary qualities are those of the photograph, yet they remain paintings.  This colision between visual frames of reference results in images that feel both nostalgic and impersonal."  </q6></q5></q4>
