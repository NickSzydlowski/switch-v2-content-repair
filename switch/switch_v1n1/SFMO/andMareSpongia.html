<q7><q8><q9>Mare Spongia is a <STRONG><A HREF="performance.html">performance</A></STRONG> 
artist based in New York.  Her work ranges from guerrilla performance to traditional photographic work.  The piece that was in this show is titled, I think I know Where Duchamp's Urinal Is.  My guide came upon it by accident
and it was a pleasant surprise.  If you don't look for this piece you won't see it.  It is both in the Women's and Men's bathrooms.  The bathrooms are located on the ground floor of the museum.  My guide, PDQ, saw the sign in the men's bathroom.  Apparently there was a sign over one of the urinal's that said:  This Is Not Duchamp's Urinal and below it there was a picture of the infamous urinal that Duchamp submitted to the non-juried show of the American Society of Independent Artists in 1917.  The sign and photo are quite small, approximately 3" x 5".  Mare Spongia was included in the show as part of the group of younger artists working with technological media.  Her work is reminescent of Andy Warhol and it challenges the viewer's notions about where it is appropriate to see art.
