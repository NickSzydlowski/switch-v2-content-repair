We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we have heard only of the obligation imposed  by society that it should exist:  to be truthful means using the customary metaphors--in <STRONG><A HREF="moral.html">moral</A></STRONG> terms:  the 
obligation to lie according to a fixed convention, to lie herd-like in a style obligatory to all.
