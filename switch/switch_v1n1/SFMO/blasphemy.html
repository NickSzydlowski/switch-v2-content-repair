<P><q9><q8><q7>I, I, I is the refrain of my whole life, which could be heard in everything I said.  I could never talk without boasting, especially if I did it with that shattering discretion that was my specialty.  It is quite true that I always lived free and powerful.  I simply felt released in regard to all for the excellent reason that I recognized no equals.  I always considered myself more intelligent than everyone else, as I've told you, but also more sensitive and more skillful, a crack shot, an incomparable driver, a better lover. </q7></q8></q9>
