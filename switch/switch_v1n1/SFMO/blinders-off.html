blinders-off
<P>
I am a blind <STRONG><A HREF="critic.html">critic</A></STRONG>, so it is hard for me to 
judge work based on the actual visual information. My experience of the work depends on the descriptions that is given to me by my guide.  For this particular review, I hired PDQ to describe the work to me.  It could be argued that it would be better for him to write the review, since afterall he is the one who literally saw the show.  My percerption of the work is about the relationship of the pieces to each other and to the underlying ideas that the artists were expressing.  I cannot be sure I understood the work the way it was meant to be understood.  But I am sure that the things beneath the surface, the ideas that support the surface of a work are not seen with eyes.
