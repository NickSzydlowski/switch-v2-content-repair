<q4><q5><q6>By flipping over the coin of boredom, the modern aesthetic takes the narrative in the other direction.  Rather than having the connotation of nobility, boredom became an attack on the mundane aspects of fragmentation and redundance found in the modern division of labor.  It became a democratic affliction that affected everyone, from the factory worker caught in the <STRONG><A HREF="anotherstory.html">repetition</A></STRONG> of his or her specialized task, to the bureacrat filling out forms in triplicate.  Everyday life increasingly became less a problem due to shortages of production (privation), than it was a problem of the monotony of production itself.  Emerging from the ruins of boredom/nobility came alienation/commonality--a quality no longer to be savored in the poetic moment.</q6></q5></q4>
