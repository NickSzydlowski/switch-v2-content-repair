<q1><q2><q3>It's the condition of being alive.  The relationship between the artist and whoever is more a universal relationship between everybody and their condition.  So the state of dissatisfaction is a universal state for both the artist and the audience, only it's the artist who's pointing it out.
The artist in that <STRONG><A HREF="situation.html">situation</A></STRONG> has got to do something absolute.  An absolute form in itself.  It can't be questionable.  I mean it can't be interesting or boring, or randomly exciting, or new or fresh, or dramatic or undramatic.  It can be all of those things, but it's got to be them spontaneously.  It can't be made to be them.  It has got to be those things because that's what it is; that's the nature of it to be that way.  Because when you have decided you will absorb the energy of the audience, and permit the audience to come toward you in such a way that you absorb the audience's anxiety and present the audience back with that anxiety, that has to be a totally genuine thing.</q3></q2></q1>
