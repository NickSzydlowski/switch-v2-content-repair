<q4><q5><q6>But what do I care?  Don't lies eventually lead to the truth?  And don't all my stories, true or false, tend toward the same <STRONG><A HREF="conclusion.html">conclusion</A></STRONG>?  Don't they all have the same meaning?  So what does it matter whether they are true or false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and of what I am?  Sometimes it is easier to see clearly into the liar than into the man who tells the truth.  Truth, like light, blinds.  Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.</q6></q5></q4>
