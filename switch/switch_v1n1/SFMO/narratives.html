<q4><q5><q6>We took the elevator to the fourth flour and began our journey.  Our first stop was a video installation by Chantal Ackerman.  There were eight rows of televisions in groupings of three.  We stood where one could see the most number of televions and waited.  On the monitors, there were images of people waiting in lines, farmers, a woman eating, another adjusting her bra strap, two men speaking, cars driving, people walking.  Each monitor had a story to tell, insignificant if looked at seperately but significant if looked at as a whole.  Waiting was one of the themes of this work. In the background a woman's voice was telling <STRONG><A HREF="anotherstory.html">another story</A></STRONG>, slowly and very deliberately.  A story did unfold the longer we looked at the images.  People doing their day to day activities and sometimes they would take note of the camera.  They would look back, and their glance is what the woman's voice would speak of the in the background.  Their glance was a reminder of their individuality.
