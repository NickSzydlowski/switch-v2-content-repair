<q1><q2><q3>Antisituationsists are formalists at heart, but 
they would never admit to that.  Not only are they formalists 
but they also hate any art that challenges their notions of 
what is art.  They tend to be boring and are members of the
group:  Believe everything you see.  They like two kinds of 
art which actually refers back to them:  predictable art and 
boring art.  They hate the idea of surprise, shock, and chance 
in art and most of all they hate the idea of ideas.  They are 
famous for their lack of thought or insight.  They are the same 
people who will look at Richter's work and only see his expert
