<q3>I come at last to death and to the attitude we have toward it.  On this point everything has been said and it is only proper to avoid pathos.  Yet one will never be sufficiently surprised that everyone lives as if no one "knew."</q3>
<P><q9><q8><q7>This is because in reality there is no experience of death.  Properly speaking, nothing has been experienced but what has been lived and made conscious.  Here, it is barely possible to speak of the experience of others' deaths.  It is a substitute, an illusion, and it never quite convinces us.  That melancholy convention cannot be persuasive.  The horror comes in reality from the mathematical aspect of the event.  If time frightens us, this is because it works out the problem and the solution comes afterward.
