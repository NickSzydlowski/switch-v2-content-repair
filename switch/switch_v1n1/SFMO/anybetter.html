Belief therefore doesn't occupy the centre ground, nor does it constitute the basis for honestly pretending.  What is involved in doing the latter is that you are making you actions relative.  It is more like resigning oneself to the fact that everyone has to take something on trust for his or her actions to have meaning.  If you accept this as a common human condition, you could make a pact with each other to agree that there is an honest way of pretending.</q6></q5></q4>
