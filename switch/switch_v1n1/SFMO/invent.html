<q7><q8><q9>"Artists are too busy trying to invent ideas.  There must be some recipe book somewhere that teaches you how to cook ideas.  You take all these <STRONG><A HREF="raw.html">raw</A></STRONG> materials, mix them up, 
bake or boil or microwave them and you get an idea.  Or maybe there should be an Idea 
Store and you go there and buy an idea."  This quote truly exemplifies Mare's philosophy.  </q9></q8></q7>
