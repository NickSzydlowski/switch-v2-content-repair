<H1>Conclusion</H1>

<P>
You might want to start over.  It's always different when you go back to something.  Anyhow, the catalogue is so pretty.  It will sit on my bookshelf next to all of my other catalogues.  I collect them because I like catalogues more than the actual art.  They weigh less and take up less room.  They have lots of pictures and text and they explain everything clearly.  The catalogue for this show was the only thing that I actually saw.
