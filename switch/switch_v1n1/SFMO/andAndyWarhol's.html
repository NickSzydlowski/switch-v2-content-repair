Business art is the step that comes after Art.  I started as a commercial artist, and I want to finish as a business artist.  After I did the thing called "art  or whatever it's called, I went into business art.  I wanted to be an Art Businessman or a Business Artist.  Being good in <STRONG><A HREF="business.html">business</A></STRONG> is the most fascinating kind of art.  During the hippie era people put down the idea of business--they'd say, "Money is bad," and "Working is bad," but making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.
