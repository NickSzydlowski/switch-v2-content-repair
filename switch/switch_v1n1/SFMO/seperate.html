<q4><q5><q6>When you present yourself in such a way that you say, "Here I am trying to sing before you.  I can't sing, but I'm trying to sing.  And it's totally obvious that I can't sing," then you're no better than they are.  That's the way they are.  They know they can't sing.  Here you are doing what they can do, doing exactly what they can do, and you're not being <STRONG><A HREF="anybetter.html">any better</A></STRONG> than them.  You're not allowing yourself to be any better for them.  They're embarrassed you're not any better than they are.  They're also irritated you're not any better than they are.  They've relegated everything to professionals.</q6></q5></q4>
