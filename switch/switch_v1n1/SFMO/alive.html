<P><q9><q8><q7>I hate him.  I hate him when I see him.  I hate him when I don't see him.  I hate the idea of him.  It's not his fault that he is what he is and says all that he says.  I just wish that I didn't have to witness his every act of stupidity.  He is so big that there is no getting away from him.  And he grows bigger everyday.  The sight of him insults my entire being.  He has no ideas what it means to be alive.</q7></q8></q9>
