<q4><q5><q6>"Art"  produces safety because it produces <STRONG><A HREF="distance.html">distance</A></STRONG>.  Maybe this is a 
reason that we respond to this show the way that we do.  In other words we are voyeurs. It's a different kind of voyeurism, it's a kind of voyeurism without any implications.  The person being observed is "dead" as it were.  But there is no risk from that subject.  No threat of the subjects rejecting us, we can spend as much time as we want looking at them yet we have no connections we them.  With Andy Warhol's accident photos, we are not there at the scene and we cannot do a thing to help these people.  With Nan's images, that's a whole different world for me and I would wonder what their response to me would be if we were actually in the same room.  In real life you can't just look at people that way, it's rude and it means something.</q6></q5></q4>
