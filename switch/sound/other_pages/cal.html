Siggraph '96 in New Orleans<BR>
The <STRONG>wango:iw</STRONG> art project explores the capabilities of signs,
symbols and languages to devise a model for communication in a networked
accessible VRML environment. By addressing the issue of universal communication
and ownership, Team CADRE is collaboratively developing a code of signs
and symbols to create a new means of communication based on individual perception.<BR>
<STRONG>Wango:iw</STRONG> is a technology based art installation which will
evolve in participant interaction. The participant will be engaged in network
exploration. The experience is a process of exploring our system and creating
a place for people to interact and communicate in visual networked spaces.
