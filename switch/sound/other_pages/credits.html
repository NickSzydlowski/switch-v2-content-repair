<I><STRONG>Switch</STRONG></I> is the electronic arts journal of the C.A.D.R.E.
Institute in San Jose, California. We are interested in fostering a critical
viewpoint on issues and developments wherever crossovers between art and
technology occur. In order to do this we rely largely on the written word.
Our main articles focus on various aspects of computer-related technology
by reporting, analyzing and discussing these art forms in the San Francisco
Bay Area and beyond. We will provide an outlet for new critical writers
as well as recognized experts in the field. We also hope to generate or
encourage collaboration with others who are working and considering similar
issues through various other communication inlets such as e-mail and teleconferencing.

<BR>
The <A HREF="call.html">next</A> issue of <B><I>Switch</I> </B>will focus
on MUDs and other forms of interactive on-line narrative.<BR>
