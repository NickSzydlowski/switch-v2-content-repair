This issue of <I>Switch</I> focuses on an area that includes a broad spectrum
of artists and theoreticians who possess innovative and varied ideas. They
use creative thought and experimentation with new technologies to speak
the ancient language of &quot;Sound&quot; in new ways. <BR>
<BR>
The &quot;validity&quot; of electronic art is still under scrutiny -- is
it art or is it technology? Agostino Di Scipio addresses this topic directly
in his article, when he questions Heidegger:</STRONG> 
<MENU>According to Heidegger's arguments, technology should be considered
a human activity extraneous to the artist's work...things like electronic
art or computer music - and even worse, computational approaches to artistic
creation (e.g. algorithmic composition) - would account for among the least
desirable manifistations of technological understanding, for they testify
a change in - and even a betrayal of - the function of art...How do artists
(musicians among them) transform concepts and visions into tangible, audible,
perceivable objects called (musical) works? How do artists <I>implement</I>
<I>ideas</I>? - <I>Di Scipio</I> 
</MENU>
<STRONG><BR>
Larry Wendt's article explores in length the relationship he sees in the
concepts inherent to sound-text composition and sound poetry, with the random
and flexible structure of hypertext:</STRONG> 
<MENU>A fragmentary and ``noisy'' structure is generated, composed of repetitive
and episodic anecdotes: where a particular sign might be reversed, exchanged,
or confused with another. It is a characteristic we often observe in the
recounting of a myth. There is no linear beginning, middle, and end. Rather
it exists at the interface between the receding, imagined past and an ever-changing,
incomprehensible present. It is a form of narrative which hypertext is now
attempting to inherit: a rhisomic structure in which the linear hierarchy
of beginning, middle, and end implodes upon itself to become a point from
which all logical movement is directed by frenzied acts of assembling partial
random inventories. It is narrative as genealogy. -<I>Wendt</I> 
</MENU>
<STRONG><BR>
Several of the events held by SoundCulture in the Bay Area this spring are
reviewed, and an in-depth interview with the director of SouncCulture and
sound artist, Ed Osborn, describes the history of SoundCulture as well as
some of the current uses of Sound by contemporary artists.<BR>
<BR>
We hope you find this issue of <I>Switch </I>both enjoyable and thought-provoking,
and we welcome your feedback, should you feel so inclined.</STRONG>
