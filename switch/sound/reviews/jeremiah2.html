As I'm staying near the bus line, I've decided to meet the bus part way
into its route. The bus arrives, and I want to make sure its the right one.
Before I get on, I ask the driver,  &quot;Are there a bunch of birds on
this bus?&quot; <BR>
<MENU>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is this the bus for the SoundCulture event?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know anything about anything like that.&quot;
</MENU>
<BR>
I notice a man several seats behind the driver waving at me, motioning for
me to be quiet and not give away the secret. This is interesting, because
I am not aware that there is a secret. I get on and move toward the back,
where I find a seat near some people I recognize from other SoundCulture
events. (I must be in the right place...) <BR>
<BR>
A few minutes later as we make our way through the city toward the Golden
Gate Bridge, tape players begin to appear from various hidden locations
- inside a toolbox, a pocket, a picnic basket, a backpack. Birds start to
make appearances. A loon is calling up near the front. A meadowlark, a magpie.
A flock of geese appear to my right, sparrows across the aisle, blue night
herons to my left! By the time we start across the bridge, a veritable cacophony
of aviary vocalizations fills the bus. <BR>
<BR>
Responses to the sound amongst the bus riders are mixed. <BR>
<MENU>&quot;I love birds! I have a parrot, and I had a Macaw growing up!&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's insufferable, that noise. You'll have to turn it off!&quot;
</MENU>
<BR>
The driver seems to be amongst the dissenting bunch. His amplified voice
descends over the bus like a dioxin-based defoliant.  &quot;All Right! Please
keep it down now...(pause) I'll ask one more time, please keep the noise
down.&quot;  When the noise does not cease, he comes back over the PA, &quot;I'll
tell you one more time: It's very easy for me to pull over and start handing
out transfers! (pause) I get paid by the hour.&quot;  Presumably, he is
telling us this to make us aware that he'll gladly spend the time to remove
us all individually from the bus. <BR>
<BR>
After some discussion, we decide that everyone will stay on the bus, leaving
their tape players turned off until we're within one stop of our destination.
<BR>
<BR>
We pull into the San Raphael station, aviary cacophony back in full-swing.
Departing the bus, a couple of women discuss how they like the sounds, and
one man comments,  &quot;Those people should be shot, along with the birds!&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The migration continues up main street, stopping in a thrift store along
the way. The three women working in the thrift store seem delighted to have
this large group of bird-sound toting people coming in. They tell bird stories.
One woman used to live in a house with birds in the attic.  &quot;I hate
them! They used to fly in my hair!&quot;   We asked her, &quot;What kind
of birds were they?&quot;  &quot;I don't know - flying birds!&quot; <BR>
