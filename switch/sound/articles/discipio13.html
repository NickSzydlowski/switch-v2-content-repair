Let me conclude by addressing again Heidegger's notion that art has a role
in our relationship to technology. Indeed, that notion would be correct
under the assumption - opposite to Heidegger's, though - that technology
is not a metaphysical, autonomous process blind to the cultural context
and external to the process and the experience of art - but, instead, a
dimension within which and by which artists themselves can signify their
role in the social context. This means that artists, musicians among them,
can be <I>interpreters</I> of technology, provided that they actively participate
in the knowledge domain and the hermeneutic dimensions of the t&Egrave;chne
of music.<BR>
<BR>
However, Heidegger's notion would be tautologic under the assumption - to
which I subscribe, but opposite to Heidegger's, again - that an artist's
work actually always implies a dynamical, innovative approach on technology,
as only by questioning and transforming her/his own t&Egrave;chne can artists
determine the strategies and methods by which they do create something.
To be able to speak their language - and to speak to others - artists challenge
the language and the methods by which they speak it - thereby challenging
others as well. <BR>
