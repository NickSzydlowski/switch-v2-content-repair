<P><B><STRONG>YT: Do you consider yourself a sound artist?</STRONG></B><BR>
<BR>
EO: Yes, but that title doesn't say very much about what I do. It says something
about technique but it doesn't say anything about the work. In addition,
the term doesn't mean a great deal to anyone who isn't already familiar
with the field, so even though I use the term to describe what I do, it
is of limited usefulness. The vagueness of the term points to the fact that
the field isn't as recognized as it should be and that there isn't a formalized
practice of it. The variety of forms in which artists are using sound preclude
a solid definition of the field. This is related to the fact that most arts-presenting
institutions are usually ill-equipped to deal with sound art - no surprise
since almost none of them were designed for it. <B><STRONG>Gallery spaces
are generally set up to look at art but not to listen to it.</STRONG> </B>In
those spaces there are often problems with sound from one piece bleeding
into another, or the sonic qualities of an exhibition space aren't suited
for sound work - the flat walls cause lots of reverberation which may not
be desirable. In addition, the structures of institutions that present music
or performance can sometimes also be a detriment to the presentation of
sound art. Sometimes a theater-type space is all that is available and that
is sometimes not suitable to particular types of sound work. In addition,
sound art performances are occasionally scheduled on concerts with music.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, at the very least it is difficult
for a listener to change their way of listening from musical habits to other
modes in the middle of a concert. So generally it is difficult for those
kinds of institutional structures to accommodate the variety of work that
is found in the field of sound art. All the organizations that participated
in <B><STRONG><A HREF="Review%20of%20SC.html">SoundCulture</A> </STRONG></B>were,
to their credit, very open-minded about all of these issues. <B><STRONG>But
even the most generous program director is going to think twice before rebuilding
their gallery space to handle a special project, no matter what it is.</STRONG></B><BR>
<BR>
In some senses, the closest ideal institution is radio because it is experienced
only as sound and listening to radio tends to be a personal kind of experience.
But of course there are no visuals with radio, so that knocks out a great
deal of possible work right there. That aside, radio is a very good medium
for sound art. The main problem lies in acquiring radio space for experimental
projects, since all of the commercial and non-commercial broadcast channels
available are very tightly formatted. And that formatting has set up a rather
rigid set of expectations among both programmers and audience about what
the possibilities of radio are. So spaces on radio that are open to experimental
work are not that common.<STRONG> </STRONG>Fortunately for <B><STRONG><A HREF="Review%20of%20SC.html">SoundCulture</A></STRONG></B>,
we had the cooperation of KPFA, which offers much more space for experimentation
than any other radio station around here except maybe for the unlicensed
radio transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<B><STRONG>So it's an art form that takes on a wide variety of formats,
but one of the artifacts of that is that doesn't fit very well into any
existing institutional frameworks.</STRONG></B> In pursuing my own career,
I have lost count of times when a gallery director would say, &quot;Well,
that's very interesting but you know, we never had a sound piece here before
and we wouldn't know what we would do with it.&quot; It's not really that
hard to deal with but it is true that galleries generally are not set up
for it. I had a review recently of an exhibition I did in Michigan where
the writer said that sound did not belong in gallery or museum settings;
he missed the fact that those places are not designed for sound in the first
place.<B><STRONG> </STRONG></B>But that review did make clear two things.
<B><STRONG>One, there is a real need for education and the inclusion of
sound in the standard arts practices and two, there is likely to be a great
deal of resistance to the form in part because by its nature it slips across
the boundaries and categories that everyone is used to in visual arts culture.</STRONG></B>
Since <B><STRONG><A HREF="SoundCulture.html">SoundCulture</A></STRONG></B>
highlighted the fact that sound art is a solid field, hopefully it will
help to overcome some of this resistance and garner the area a bit more
attention. As that happens, describing oneself as a sound artist will not
be quite such a novelty, nor will it lead to the kinds of puzzlement that
I am now used to encountering.<BR>
