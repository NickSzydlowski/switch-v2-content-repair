Since we as humans react to movement, many ofhis works in artificial life are mechanical devices existing in real spaceand responding to humans in their environment. Their discussion ranges overa broad gamut of issues that stems from the desire to create life. <BR><BR>And finally, in a fascinating exploration of developing biological mechanisms,Loretta L. Lange probes the realm of nano-technology and the future envisionedby K. Eric Drexler. Lange critiques a recent book by <A HREF="../LLL/nanobart.html">EdRegis</A> and attempts to come to terms with the implications of an idealizedbiotechnical solution to cultural problems.<BR><BR>Check out the Switch <A HREF="gateway.html">Gateway</A> and calendar section.This time our site will change on an on-going basis, as our new dedicatedworkstation gives us better access to our server.
