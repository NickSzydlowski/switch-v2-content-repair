<HEAD>    <TITLE>Galatea 2.2 Review</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffb1ae" LINK="#f81e07"><H1><A HREF="../cover.html"><IMG SRC="switch.gif"WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="31" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom BORDER="1"></A></H1><H1><CENTER>Galatea 2.2 By Richard Powers </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>By Asil</CENTER></H3><H3><HR></H3>The basic premise of Galatea 2.2 is based on the concept that a computercan gain awareness of self -- whether that is what we intended or not. RichardPowers (our fictitious protagonist) is a writer who returns to his almamater after living abroad. His station as humanist-in-residence at the universityallows him to run into Philip Lentz, a cognitive neurologist of unreservedcharacter. <BR><BR>Powers is soon enticed into collaborating on a project to model the humanbrain, using a computer-based neural network. Their chief goal is  to feedthis thing (a later version of which gets named Helen) enough informationto enable it to pass a comprehensive exam in English lit. <BR><BR>OK. Out the door the book falls a little short on the technical angle ofthings. Ultimately, we don't care, and it works to the benefit of the plot.Why? Because, this is not so much a story about how one can configure acomputer to interpret meaning, as it is about how we assimilate informationin general. And truthfully, that accounts for only about one third of thebook anyway. <BR><BR>Powers is really more interested in giving us his personal story, sincehe's the one with the all the required love and tragedy. He manages to weavethe all the characters, including the precious Helen, together in a waythat gives us insight into human consciousness. If you are looking to findout more about configuring your network for brilliance, this might providefood for thought; not much more. However, if you are intrigued by the cognizanthuman brain and how we associate information with emotion you will not bedisappointed.<BR><P><CENTER><HR><BR><A HREF="review.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50"ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><BR><BR><A HREF="articles.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ1.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31"ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../pdq/rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ2.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="http://cadre.sjsu.edu/zoo/"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ3.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="calpg.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ4.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="review.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ5.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></BODY>
