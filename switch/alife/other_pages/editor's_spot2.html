The rulesfor alife follow biological rules: they are born, they eat, they reproduce,and they die. We can think of them as non-threatening as long as they livein the computer, assuming that a safe distance exists between computersand us -- a gap which narrows every day. If a cellular automata lives, albeiton a source of energy that we control, then <STRONG>Sarah Farsad</STRONG>'sarticle appropriately asks whether artificial life forms can fall in <A HREF="../sfarsad/artif_love.html">love</A>,which presupposes that they think. <BR><BR>If artificial life thinks it must be on a far different level from thatof artificial intelligence. Producing an equivalent to the human brain requiresa huge investment of time and resources. The fictional account of man, mindand machine in <A HREF="galatea.html">Galatea 2.2</A>, assessed in a reviewby <STRONG>Asil</STRONG>, relies on the art of literature to convey theseeds of sentience. The goal of AI (language) is so diametrically opposedto that of the squiggles and flocking of alife (behavioral), that it isamazing that it can take so long to understand the difference. <BR><BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="editor%27s_spot1.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Page 1"></A><A HREF="editor%27s_spot3.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Page 3"></A></CENTER></BODY>
