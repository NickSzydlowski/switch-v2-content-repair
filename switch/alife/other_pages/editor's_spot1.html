Several things have changed witheach issue and this one is no different. We have experimented with how Switchlooks on your screen and the way you navigate through the articles in short,single-screen pages. Give us your feedback and comments by emailing us at70451.1665@compuserve.com. This is also my last issue as editor -- pleasewelcome <STRONG>Loretta L. Lange</STRONG> as our new editor.<BR><BR>With the question of artificial life, we faced several challenges. Sincemost of us work as image-based artists, we wanted to clarify what artificiallife was, how it differs from artificial intelligence, and how it framesart in a different light. <STRONG>Rudy Rucker</STRONG>'s article describessome of the simplest forms of <A HREF="../rucker/rrintro.html">artificiallife</A>: small self-modulating algorithms that leave trails of coloredpixels on a computer screen (cellular automata). Using the word &quot;life&quot;for these graphic traces tugs at our sense of credibility, especially sincethey appear similar to many screen-savers which are, as we all know, justprograms. <BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="../cover.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Back to Cover"></A><A HREF="editor%27s_spot2.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Page 2"><BR></A><BR><A HREF="articles.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ1.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31"ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Articles"></A><A HREF="../pdq/rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ2.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"ALT="Interview"></A><A HREF="http://cadre.sjsu.edu/zoo"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ3.gif"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Project Page"></A><A HREF="calpg.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ4.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"ALT="Calendar"></A><A HREF="review.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ5.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Reviews"></A></CENTER></BODY>
