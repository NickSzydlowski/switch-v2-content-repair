They are very farfrom cognitive or conscious beings. But there was something about flockthat was kind of unpredictable, and in some ways like humans. Despite thefact that they are programmed the same, they don't act similarly nor dothey act as their expected to.</B><BR><BR>KER: Yes unpredictable very much like human beings. And that's what's sointeresting about cognition, we believe we show our thoughts and yet weonly show what we're thinking, by our behavior. With The Flock, the formis unprecedented. So it's very difficult to climb inside its circuits andtry to figure out why it's doing what it's doing. We know that they allhave the same systems and they're reacting to what they react to locally,before they'll react to what they react to as a group. In other words, onearm will be more concerned with itself getting hurt before it will be concernedwith showing a higher level of group behavior.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: Will your flock evolve? Do you foresee imbuing flock with broadercognitive abilities or incorporating other sensing capabilities like temperatureor olfactory senses?</B><BR><BR>KER: Even now The Flock has adaptive abilities. There are algorithms inthe software written by Mark Grossman that allow The Flock to adjust towhatever the average sound level is in the room. That was something we hadto add after showing the work at Siggraph to stop them from moving all ofthe time. They were designed to respond to sound and move in the directionof the sound to show that they were sensing the sound, to show robotic intentionality.But what we found was that the average sound level in the room would changeso dramatically from other machine exhibits that time that they never seemto stop dancing. Mark was able to write an algorithm that would allow themto respond to the loudest sound they heard within an average sound level.So that's kind of an adaptive ability. <BR><BR>Indeed The Flock will evolve. I hope to use methods of genetic algorithmsto allow a new Flock to evolve it's own behavior. Actually that was theoriginal idea but because of programming time and constraints it just didn'thead in that direction. Instead we used a subsumtion architecture that you'reprobably familiar with through Rodney Brooks and some of the work that'sbeen done at M.I.T. It's this kind of onion leveled approach to programmingwhere the fundamental behaviors have to do with self survival of the creatureand once individual needs are met they move onto higher and higher levelsof behavior like group behaviors. The Flock will continue to evolve. <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo6.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo8.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
