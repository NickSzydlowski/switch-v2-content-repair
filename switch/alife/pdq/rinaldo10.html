Are you going to be doing any more work with artificiallife?</B><BR><BR>KER: I have just finished a show with San Francisco artist Amy Youngs. Theshow was called <I>disMbody</I>. What interested me about that notion wasthat we are less and less aware of our bodies because we are extending oursenses so far out. Not only through television, but through every form ofmedia and medium. We don't really form a conception of the self anymorethrough our direct experience but through the experiences of others thatwe see on the media or the information we hear. So this show was concernedwith those issues of how we've become disembodied. Even the nature of languageis that of a disembodiment. It's not something you feel directly and viscerally.It's ideational. It's virtual. It exists outside of the self. One of mynext projects is a piece that just looks at the kind of hypnotic light aspectsthat TV and commercials use to hypnotize you, to seduce you. Basically it'sa TV that's focused onto a parabolic lens that amplifies the light. It'scalled Watchers and it shows you the kind of hypnotic nature of the TV lightitself. After that I plan on doing more work with fish and worms and juxtaposingthose forms with other tree like structures. I am interested in forms thatshow some kind of intelligence. I'm fascinated by circuit boards and theway they spread themselves out almost like neurons into a space interconnected,interstitial. I'm fascinated by roots and branches and the simplicity ofthose things in permitting intelligent living system.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: When you talk about television and the hypnotic aspect of the lightI was amused. I have always thought of television as the evolution of thecampfire. When I was a kid, I used to love to just stare at the fire whenwe went camping. It was just this bizarre multicolored light that was fascinatingto watch as it danced. In a lot of ways, my attraction to television issimilar to that. Often my brain is not engaged and I am simply staring atthe television. Just the other day, my friend and I where watching TV duringone of our TV sessions and I was struck by the vivid images that were passingin front of me. The images were so lush and beautiful and this was justa commercial.<BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="99%"></B><A HREF="rinaldo9.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"><A HREF="../other_pages/articles.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ1.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ2.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../matthews/webfung.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ3.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/calpg.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ4.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/review.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ5.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></BODY>
