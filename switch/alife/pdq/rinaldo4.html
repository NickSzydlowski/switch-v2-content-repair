When Ithink ahead to the future, I begin to wonder what will happen when we areactually able to create new life forms. Are there any moral issues relatedto the use/creation of artificial life?</B><BR><BR>KER: As we start to get into the higher forms of artificial life there maybe some moral issues involved. I think morality in a sense really growsout of our understanding of human pain. Our understanding and philosophyof morality grow out of our being able to project and sense what other peopleare feeling. Perhaps, as artificial life reaches higher and higher levelsof intelligence, maybe it will make us reflect back upon ourselves. Butagain I sort of doubt it. The increasing mechanization of the world doesn'tappear to make us more moral at all. In fact, at this juncture, it seemsto make us less so. In the list of questions you faxed to me, you askedif television was artificial life? That sort of relates to what I want tosay about that. I think TV is a very good example of a kind of one way connectiveimage disemenator. It's a crude one directional neural net which has moralimplications, because it effects behavior and it effects behavior for themasses in a negative way. I'll never forget reading that people perceivethe world to be a lot more dangerous than it actually is because producershave found that showing multiple murders on TV somehow compels you, it raisesyour blood level. It manipulates our physiology in a kind of rubberneckingreflex. We'll buy more products. But in the mean time, TV is subtly changingthe way our children see the world, and the way we see the world. It iscreating the world and our perception all in one. So for me, this is veryimmoral. It's an immoral use of a technology that has and intrinsic powerto inform, to make human beings better, to allow them to help each other.<BR><IMG SRC="term2.jpg" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="66" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2"><BR><BR><B>PDQ: In some sense, television almost has a life of it's own now. Itseems that there is very little control on either end. It kind of drivesitself. When I was thinking about that question I was thinking about televisionas an analogy to artificial life. Like reproduction, TV has this kind ofinsidious way of reproducing itself. And it's the hype around TV that createsthat.</B><BR><BR>KER: I like Paul Verilio's analogy of these commercial songs being a kindof ideational virus. You find yourself sitting sometime and suddenly thislittle ditty shows up in your head. It's like you can't get this ditty outof your head because the TV has somehow managed to plant it so successfullyin our brains. That's an odd form of artificial life, isn't it? <BR><BR><B>PDQ: It sounds like your describing some sort of parasite.</B><BR><BR>KER: Yes it is. exactly. It's like a parasite. It's a form of virus. Andit doesn't inform us like we were all told TV was going to do. It infectsus. Like a virus.<BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo3.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo5.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
