Howis your work perceived by artists/scientists/the general population? </B><BR><BR>KER: I guess actually, I don't believe that there is as much of a differenceand this kind of relates to some of the things we were talking about earlierabout finding an aesthetic of functionality, for instance, or an aestheticmay tell us something deeper. I don't actually believe that there is asmuch of difference between art and science as many would believe. Thereare quite a few contemporary writers writing about this very subject. Theybelieve that artist were more responsible than scientists for some of thecontemporary ways of seeing. Is there a relationship between the surrealistsand quantum space time theory? I think that science has always been necessaryfor art. I think art is a kind of science in a sense. I think artists showan amazing sense of intentionality. They ask a question. They systematicallyfind some materials to help answer that question. Because artists are alsodealing with perception, I think it also points back to the sciences. Aquestion is only valid in the universe in which it's created. Everybodylooks at an artist like Leonardo Divinci and they say, &quot;oh when arethe arts and sciences going to be combined like they were back then?&quot;I think that's happening now and I think it was happening when the Impressionistswere working with light. They were concerned with perception and ways ofseeing. I think that those are the same questions that scientists are asking.However, I doesn't mean that scientists and artists are using the same approachesand therein lies the greatest difference.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: What do you think we can learn about ourselves from your work?</B><BR><BR>KER: I think that we can learn, and one of the things I was trying to show,especially by having these three systems be stand alone computers first(essential survival needs where met first) and then only through their inter-communicationwere they allowed to emerge into this kind of group organized creature.This points to our own biology and the biology of every living creatureand the biology of the interactions of all living creatures. Life itselfis an emergent property created through trillions of cells working together.consciousness is an emergent property of trillions of cells...not that Ifully understand consciousness. But that I think that's what it points todirectly. That we are a kind of supra-organized being of many differentcells that have somehow emerged into creatures that can now show intentionalityand have intelligence and can further develop. And then all of these creaturescome together to create societies with belief systems. Now we're on theverge, with telecommunications and TV, of emerging into this kind of worldnation. It's a very exciting time.And also very scary.<BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo5.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo7.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
