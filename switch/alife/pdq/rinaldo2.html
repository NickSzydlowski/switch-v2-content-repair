And we move on toMichaelangelo and his work which was created as a tribute to reveal theglory and power of God. Now as we have become more secular the realiststry to duplicate human vision, making the illusion as close to reality aspossible. Our latest efforts are to create life, in a sense taking overwhat god does, take his place.</B><BR><BR>KER: I suppose in the core of our being we have the desire to procreateand to create life. It's something that we can't remove from the fundamentalaspect of all life, are to recreate and I suppose it does make sense thatwe have a desire not only to do that in terms of creating children, butalso in terms of creating artworks that move towards mimesis or move towardsome kind of mimicking of living systems. <BR><BR><B>PDQ: Do you think there is some inherent drive or desire in human beingsto replace God? What is it about humans that drives them to want to duplicatewhat exists?</B><BR><BR>KER: I think humans, and I actually believe that all living systems arewhat we call emergent systems. We know that DNA arises from RNA and we knowthat RNA arises from simpler molecules. Molecules themselves have a formof intelligence which is inherent to their interaction with other molecules,in the way they combine, and if your given billions and billions of years,and they estimate that life has existed for about 3.6 billion years on earthand the earth is maybe about 4.5 billion years, that molecules will organizeinto something higher than those higher molecules or RNA will organize intoDNA which has organized into cellular systems which have joined together.Margulis has this theory about non-oxygen breathing prokaryote cells ingestingoxygen breathing prokaryote breathing cells which became the ancestor ofmitochondria which are able to convert oxygen to chemical energy packets.Later, she speculates that these prokaryote ingested and organism with awhip-like tail that allowed mobility. From there you have cells workingtogether to create higher systems. I actually believe that this attemptto create artificial life and even all of the machines that surround ourlives, the wires, the pipes and everything is just a universe that is tendingtoward complexity. I think intelligent systems tend toward complexity. Ithink that's why we're getting smarter (laughs) I believe we're gettingsmarter. Now the machines are ingesting the machines. Intellegence is imbededeverywhere. <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo1.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo3.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR WIDTH="60%" SIZE="4"></CENTER></BODY>
