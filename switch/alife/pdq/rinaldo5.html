But I have anotherquestion related to the moral implications of using artificial life. I thinkwhat I was trying to get at was your thoughts regarding the ethical useof artificial life. If we're going to create artificial forms of life andtheir actually living then I have some concerns about how they would beused. You just said that when we start dealing with the higher forms ofartificial life that those kinds of ethical issues become a concern. Butwhy wouldn't those concerns exist with lower forms? The reason I ask isbecause of my understanding of environmental systems and the necessary partthat lower forms play in our existence and the function of natural systems.And also, I know that you have two pieces that incorporate living creatures,a fish in one, and tubifex worms in the other. So could you describe thosetwo pieces and address your ethics in relation to those pieces and maybein a broader sense.</B><BR><BR>KER: Yeah, I think that's an excellent question. The first piece is a tightropewalking fish tank. The piece came about when I was doing research aboutfish. I realized that fish have exquisite vision and that they see far outsideof the water. It occurred to me that we have all of these fish tanks whichare very small spaces that don't allow them to explore outside the realmof their tank. So I came up with the idea for this tightrope walking tank.And the question was, what if you gave a fish the ability to determine whereit went? Sort of how we pop into the car to drive up the street or to gosomewhere that we want to go. And my question was, would the fish use itand would the fish be comfortable? My primary concern was that the fishwas comfortable. In fact, the fish that I chose specifically was chosenbecause I felt that it would be comfortable in this environment becauseit's a non-aerated tank. It uses a Beta fish or Siamese Fighting fish whichare very aggressive fish and they live in little puddles in Thailand, verysmall spaces. Since this tank couldn't be too big, it was going to be ona tightrope, and I couldn't aerate the tank, these were the ideal fish.So the piece sort of arose out of these concerns of how I could make thefish more comfortable. But then, for me, it started to become a metaphorfor what we're doing to the earth right now. I quite agree with you thatwe, in our pursuit for intelligent systems and our seeming endless appetitesthat ...In a sense what I've done with this fish is kind of what we're doingwith the oceans. We're surrounding them with buildings. We're pouring effluentsinto the oceans that are killing the oceans. We're killing lower forms andwe're not seeing the total interdependent nature of the world. Some callit the Gaia system. We have to understand that everything is related andlower forms need to exist in order for the higher forms to exist. To me,there is no morality to that. It's just a practical issue of survival. RichardDawkins speaks of the selfish gene.<BR><BR>The second piece is called <A HREF="http:///www.ylem.org/Ylem/artists/krinaldo/emergent4.html">TechnologyRecapitulates Phylogeny</A> which comes from a quote by Earnest Heackelwhich was &quot;Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny.&quot; What that meansis that Heackel and other scientists like Glenn Gould more recently havediscovered that the child developing in the mother's womb, the ontogenyof the child reflects the phylogenetic development of human beings froma single celled creature up to what we are. So in other words, in the wombthere is a time when the baby has rudiments of gills, there is a time whenthe baby has rudiments of fins, There is a time when the baby appears tobe more like a worm than anything else. So in a sense, we're seeing thelogic of organic systems being reflected, recapitulated. And what this piecemeant is that I think we're starting to understand complex systems and theoverall interdependent nature of the earth itself. The worms and these systemsare a dynamic model to understand interdependence and sentience. Their treestructures reflect circuit boards, brain cells, roots, and even mitochondria.One of the reasons that artificial life is so important to me is becauseI really see myself as more of an ecologist than anything else. I'm tryingto point out to people that these fish on the tight rope, even though Idid make every attempt to make it comfortable, and indeed these fish onthe tightrope often live longer than the ones I have in plain bowls, interestinglybecause they seem to be having more fun moving back and forth. so I am alsotrying to push it in peoples faces and force them to ask the question, wellgee is this what we're doing to the oceans? Are we slowly draining the oceansand making them into human systems which aren't really sensitive to theinterdependent complex nature of organic systems? <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo4.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo6.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
