Rinaldo<BR>by PDQuick </CENTER><P><HR SIZE="4">Kenneth E. Rinaldo is a transdiciplinary artist living andworking in San Francisco. He is currently on the Board of Directors of YLEM,an international group of artists using science and technology. His workshave been shown in the U.S. and abroad at such shows as Image Du Futurein Montreal, Canada, the V2 Dutch Electronic Arts Festival 1995, and SigGraph1993 in Los Angeles and have been featured on television and magazines includingWired, The Discovery Channel's Know Zone and Cnet. His academic backgroundincludes Computer Science, Communications Research and Art. And he receivedhis MFA in Conceptual Art from San Francisco State University.<BR><BR>I first met <A HREF="http://www.ylem.org/Ylem/artists/krinaldo/emergent1.html">KenRinaldo</A> in 1994 when I was co-curating an exhibition of interactiveelectronic and digital media. I was immediately intrigued by <I><A HREF="http://www.ylem.org/Ylem/artists/krinaldo/emergent2.html">TheFlock</A></I>, an interactive A-life sculpture. Over the course of the exhibition,I was able to spend a lot of time with them. And what was most strikingfor me was the way they seemed to change from elegant flowing dancing beingsto spasmodic twitching creatures that recoiled when approached.<BR><BR>For this issue of Switch, I spoke with Ken about his work with artificiallife, his ideas about artist's and their role in scientific research andtelevision amongst other things.<BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo1.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"><A HREF="../other_pages/articles.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ1.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ2.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../matthews/webfung.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ3.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/calpg.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ4.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/review.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ5.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER><P></BODY>
