But as they become more complex we are more subject to their needs.I have often said that regardless of how much we want to design systemsthat are &quot;user friendly&quot; I feel that more and more we are adaptingto the technology. It's not adapting to us.</B><BR><BR>KER: I actually see it as an interesting co-evolution. It was fascinatingfor me to hear on the radio the other day that they're discovering things,for instance that bluejays actually make tools. And for me the beginningof all of this is the tool. It's the use of an object outside of the bodythat has sent us down this path of finding better intelligent tools to getwhatever we want to get done.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: One of the things that I have fantasized about when I think of thefuture of intelligent systems and artificial life, especially those whichare capable of reproducing themselves, is the possibility of intelligentautonomous life forms becoming so advanced that they are no longer interestedin creating or building for us. I see them building better tools for themselves,making their existence simpler, more efficient. Leaving us out of the loop.Then they create their own culture and social structure centered aroundtheir own needs. </B><BR><BR>KER: The use of cars is kind of like that. We've completely restructuredthe environment. We've knocked out our trees and our grass lands and we'veput in roads. We now have cars and we're always very comfortable in themand we love the freedom that they give us. But in the meantime, it's completelytransformed our environment to be more comfortable for machines than forhuman beings. And it seems like a lot of our comforts have gone that way.When I walk downtown, amongst all of the skyscrapers, it seems like a veryinhospitable, inhuman environment. There is nothing terribly comfortableabout having the sun blocked from me because a super technical superstructureis blocking it. And I think that's all the results of mechanization androbotics and complex systems. One of the philosophies of my work is thatwe have a lot to learn from natural systems. And I think that scientists,robotisists, computer scientists and a-life people are really understandingthat, that natural systems are going to teach us about interdependence andabout interdependent systems. They are trying not to make systems that areone dimensional that won't really think or be considerate of other thingsin their environment. Paul Hawkins talks about making products that areintrinsically designed to be used and to pass on into another form of evolvedthing and just degrade naturally for instance, or be able to be used forsome other thing. So in other words, not thinking of the product itselfas just whatever it's intended use was but thinking of the after life ofthe product and what other systems it's going to go into. <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo8.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo10.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER><P></BODY>
