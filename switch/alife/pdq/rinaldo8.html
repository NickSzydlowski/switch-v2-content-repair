It's interesting to lookat research that's been done into viruses for instance. I'm always intriguedand encouraged to hear that people aren't sure where life begins. We knowthat viruses show certain aspects of living systems as James Greer Millerhas defined the 20 subsystems that all living systems should have. Viruseswith RNA evolve and change but we're not quite sure if they're alive. Evenwhen you see molecular interactions, you wouldn't call one molecule interactingwith another a form of life and yet the molecules themselves have a formof intelligence which is intrinsic to their structure and their environmentalinteractions. So, yeah I think the flock is alive.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: I remember a professor talking about software as being alive, thatsoftware was capable of doing and reacting in ways that were not part ofit's functionality.</B><BR><BR>KER: I agree. I'm always excited and scared to hear stories about the telephoneswitching networks. These switching networks are completely autonomous andthey will route calls the most efficient way. But for some reason, oncein a while, the switching networks go crazy and nobody quite understandswhy. I am always fascinated to hear about software systems that show emergentproperties or properties of evolution. There are theories of life itselfwhich say that life in a sense is a kind of mutation of something. Backto God, people have said that God created life from clay. There are researchersthat believe that clay may indeed have been the origin of life. As watermoved through clay, it would cause certain chemical changes in the claythat were mutations for the clay. Once the mutation caught on, it wouldspread through the clay and soon the clay itself would have undergone acomplete structural change allowing for the next level of molecular evolution.So when I hear about computers, complex systems, software systems and viruseson computers they do seem to have elements and aspects of living systemssuch as the ability to evolve and mutate.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: I have always been fascinated with the progression that technologyhas been taking toward more and more autonomous systems.</B><BR><BR>KER: That gets back to the moral issues. We already know that robots whichare not intelligent, well they have a level of intelligence but they'reautonomous... <BR><BR><B>PDQ: Intelligent but not conscious.</B><BR><BR>KER: Yeah they're not conscious. But we already know that they're puttinghuman beings out of work. So you asked about moral issues. What if we dohave a system that is so bright that it puts everybody out of work and itcan be mass produced or it can mass produce itself. Will human beings justbecome the...I mean sometimes I feel like I'm just here to service the machinesthat I have in my life. Who's serving who.<BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo7.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo9.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HRWIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
