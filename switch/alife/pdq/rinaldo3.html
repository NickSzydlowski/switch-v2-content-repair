For instance, a computer scientist goes into a particularschool and learns a particular area of expertise that... it's not very crossassociative. It draws on other areas but for the most part is very focusedon computer science. I think what is so interesting about artificial lifein particular is that it's a kind bi-association of many areas of expertise.It looks at biological systems, computers, mathematics, dynamics and non-linearsystems and it attempts to organize inorganic matter to behave in organicways and forms. So I think artists are very excited and I think artistsin particular can bring together different kinds of cross associations orspecialties which really permit new perspectives that are not limited byscientific procedures and approaches which can be limited and very focused.Artists are driven by different things. Their not trying to create a robotthat can make something but a robot that creates a form of unique aestheticand asks questions. For me the way The Flock was organized and sang to eachother with telephone tones and moved was a form of aesthetic far outsideof the realm of creating robots which are purposeful. We are living an intensiveinformation rich society where we can draw from thousand of different areasof expertise. And I think what's great about artists is that they can drawfrom any of those things without limits or business considerations. Freeassociation underlines the creative process. I think that it's hard to saywhat artists working in artificial life will bring to it. But perhaps aestheticsor a works form, as opposed to something purposeful, has much to teach.<BR><BR><B>PDQ: Aside from its importance in research related to the understandingof living systems, is there anything else that we can learn from artificiallife?</B> <BR><BR>KER: I actually believe that the primary purpose of a-life is that weregoing to learn that the nature and organization of matter really doesn'thave as much to do with the substance as it has to do with the organizationof that substance. I really do believe that is the primary thing that weare going to learn from artificial life. I think that eventually we willcreate systems that are indeed considered artificial life. I don't thinkwe've gotten anywhere remotely close to that. We've created things thatprobably have the intelligence of a virus at this point or a snail perhaps.But you asked if there is there is anything outside that we can learn fromartificial life. Maybe we'll learn sensitivity to real forms of life. Ifour machines can think and breath maybe it will somehow make us more sensitiveto real life, or perhaps not. Maybe it will make us less so. <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo2.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo4.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
