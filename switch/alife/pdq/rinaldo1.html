If you look at the cavesin Lascaux for instance and the drawings of bison on the cave walls. Thatwas an attempt to recreate reality in a pictorial way. They knew it wasn'tthe bison but they knew that it would communicate some kind of likenessof a bison. You can look at artists like Michelangelo and his desire togive the illusion of life by modeling every muscle. Being so aware of everymovement of the muscle and trying to give an illusion of life, or Leonardowith his paintings and how carefully he chose to mimic skin tones. You canstart at the beginning of art and keep working your way up find realistartists trying to create some sort of illusion of realism in their work.And I think, in a sense, that is all an attempt at a form of artificiallife. You can even look back at people like Vaucanson that did the amazingduck that would eat, and quack so realistically that people thought it wasa real duck. It wasn't artificial life but it was an attempt toward mimesisand creating the illusion of life. Even the Jaquet-Droz family that hadcreated automatons that could write was an attempt at creating an illusionof life. Of course, with these early works we know that they were stoneand they were cam driven, they were not alive, even though they tried tocreate and illusion of life. But, with artificial life and with systems,non linear systems in particular, for the very first time artists have accessto these tools and can create something that is perhaps living or createan illusion of life that takes us to far beyond the bison on the wall orthe muscle of Michaelangelo's sculpture. It is interesting that you mentionthe Lasceaux caves, Michaelangelo, and the Realists in relation to artificiallife. <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="4"><A HREF="rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="rinaldo2.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
