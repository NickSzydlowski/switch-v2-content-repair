The 3H technologyis meaningful in the realization of information machines (computers) intheir three phases of development. <BR><BR>The first phase encompasses <B>Hand</B> technology and is represented bycomputers with which we communicate by keyboard--by hand (first &quot;H&quot;)--today'scomputers. <BR><BR>The second &quot;H&quot; phase--<B>Head</B>--includes those which will beautonomic intelligent inforamtion machines, capable of movement in spaceand time and of adapting tho their enviornment, realized on the principlesof brain functions. The first generation of such machines has already beenbuilt utilizing artificial neural networks, with the ultimate achievementof this generation being some kind of awareness as a preamble to the &quot;artificial&quot;consciousness of the next generation. <BR><BR>The third phase, <B>Heart</B>, will consist of ocmputers possessing elementsof &quot;artificial&quot; consciousness and &quot;artificial&quot; emotions,on the basis of which they will be alb e to self-adapt relations amonstthemselves nad between; thenm and their environment, including their relationswith human beings. <BR><BR>-Quote from <I>Fullerene C60</I></TT><BR><BR><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart5.html"><IMG SRC="../../../../PageMill_Images/image4.html"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR></BODY>
