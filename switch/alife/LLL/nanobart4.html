But how isthis future going to come about? While Drexler the futurist was making hispredictions about a future run by nanotechnology, chemists were making discoveriesthat could potentially make those visions a reality. </TT><H2><TT>Buckyballs </TT></H2><TT>My curiosity about the future that Drexler pictures led me to another<A HREF="FULLEREN.html">book</A> entitled <CITE>Fullerene C60 - History,Physics, Nanobiology, Nanotechnology</CITE>. The pages of this volume arefilled with the theoretical and practical potentials of nanotechnology fromthe chemist's point of view. Yet surprisingly the underlying theme seemsto be a belief in what some might call coincidences, but what this bookimplies is <A HREF="SERENDI.html">serendipity</A>. <BR></TT><IMG SRC="BUCKY11.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="70" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="3"><TT>Research as early as 1970 by a Japanese researcher predictedthe existence of the <A HREF="C60.html">C60</A> molecule.
