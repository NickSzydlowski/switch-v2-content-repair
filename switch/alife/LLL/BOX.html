And then it would give you abouta kilogram of product. It's an appliance which if you turn it on and giveit the raw materials and press the right buttons, will produce any objectin the catalog. <BR><BR>The range of products that can be produced is large, encompassing high-performancestructures, massively parallel supercomputers, and additional molecularmanufacturing systems. Between the input of raw materials and the removalof finished products, no labor is necessary. <BR><BR><CITE>-Drexler, quoted from Nano <BR><BR></CITE></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart2.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></BODY>
