Movingparts on this scale can be small and fast enough to make the computer fasterthan today's electronic machines. A desktop machine could then have moreraw computational power than any computer in the world today. In fact, itcould have more raw power than all the computers in the world today combined.In these terms -- which imply nothing about intelligence -- such a machinewould have the raw power of a million human brains.<BR><BR>-quote by Eric Drexler from <CITE>Nano <BR><BR></CITE></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart1a.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></BODY>
