I've onlyscratched the surface with my exploration of a few points of view. <BR><BR>Drexler's Foresight Institute continues to monitor the progress of nanotechnologywith its conferences, the first of which was held in 1989. So far therehave been several conferences, and another coming up. These conferencesbring together scientific researchers (chemists, engineers, physicists),business executives, environmentalists, and others interested the socialand political potentials of nanotechnology. Futurists and scientists areexamining and plotting the future of our world.<BR><BR>Where are the artists? There is one corporation, Nanothinc which claimsto One of Nanothinc's objectives is to connect science and technology withart and culture:<BR> <BR>&quot;<I>Our company strives to globally link the power of imagination andcreativity, expressed in rich and dramatic art forms, with the literal underpinningsof this powerful yet nascent technology. <BR>Building bridges, both in cultural and scientific spheres, we believe isof considerable importancand a worthy corporate endeavour.&quot;<BR></I> <BR>Their web site offers an idea of their progress and focus. Their <A HREF="http://www.nanothinc.com/NanoWorld/NanoGallery/gallery.html">nanogallery</A>provides a peek at some artists who are dealing with this issue. <BR><BR>In 1992 Drexler was brought as an expert witness on molecular nanotechnologybefore the, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Subcommitteeon Science, Technology and Space. When pressed for a date by then-SenatorGore during his testimony, he stated &quot;...fifteen years would not besurprising for major large-scale applications.&quot; That's 2007.<BR><BR>Koruga predicts, using his &quot;temporal icosahedron model&quot; basedon the C60 molecule, that in 2020 &quot;technology and engineering basedon the C60 molecule will beome a dominant cosmic 'light machine' which willreversibly transform human information directly to machine and vice versa.&quot;If this sounds like science fiction, once upon a time so did a lot of otherthings that we take for granted today.<BR><BR>Nanotechnology offers many positive and negative potentials for our future.As Jerry Mander in <I>Absence of the Sacred</I> points out, Dupont's promiseof <CITE>Better things for better living through chemistry</CITE>, and Westinghouse's<I>There's a lift to living electronically</I>, have not exactly broughtus utopia. In regard to current technologies, Mander states (with the benefitof hindsight), &quot;...we are at an appropropriate moment to question whetherthis path we have chosen and celebrated has lived up to its promise, andif not, if it ever will.&quot;<BR><BR>Nanotechnology is an infant technology, the path has not yet been chosen.Langdon Winner in <I>The Whale and the Reactor</I> notes, &quot;We are seldominclined to examine, discuss or judge pending innovations.&quot; <BR><BR>Perhaps it's time. <BR><P><CENTER></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart11.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"><A HREF="../other_pages/articles.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ1.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../pdq/rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ2.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../matthews/webfung.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ3.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/calpg.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ4.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/review.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ5.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></BODY>
