He ties the 5-fold symmetrical structureof Fullerenes and Bio-Fullerenes to the ancient belief systems of the Greeks,Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians, showing how each of them relates. The mathematicsand chemistry discussed in <I>Fullerene C60</I> is far beyond my immediatecomprehension, but I do get an intuitive grasp of what is Koruga is attemptingto get across. <BR><BR>I am intrigued by what Koruga calls a &quot;synergy of art and science.&quot;He indicates a particular interest in the relationship of art and new technologybased upon 5-fold symmetry and has worked with artists in this regard. </TT><H2><TT>The Golden Mean </TT></H2><TT>In looking back over art historical instances, there are a number ofapproaches to artistic representation using <A HREF="golden.html">GoldenMean</A>, divine proportion, and geometrical and mathematical models. Itis interesting to note that &quot;children instinctively represent thingsthey see in geometrical symbols&quot; (<I>Encyclopedia Britannica)</I></TT>.<TT><BR><BR>The Golden Mean (or Section) was defined by Lucas Pacioli, during the Renaissancein his treatise Divina proportione. His ideas influenced Leonardo and Durer.Neo-impressionists were intrigued by mathematical models as well as theCubists, who defined their representation of the world through this mathematicalsystem of proportion, even naming their exhibition <I>Section d'Or (TheGolden Section)</I>. <BR><BR>Who knows if the obsession Cezanne had with nature didn't originate withan intuitive knowledge of the basic 5-fold symmetry of life, as seen inKoruga's mind synergy -- the unconscious and the conscious coming together?<BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="5"></TT><A HREF="nanobart10.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart12.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
