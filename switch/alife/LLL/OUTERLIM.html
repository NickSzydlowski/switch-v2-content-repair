<HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#bcb4ba" LINK="#862c86"><HR SIZE="5"><H3><TT>Recent Outer Limits Episode...</TT></H3><TT>This episode offers a peek at one possible future -- nanotechnologygone awry. A young professor finds out he has terminal cancer and is givenat the most a year to live. <BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>He works at a university where a researcheris attempting to get funding for a nanotechnology experiment, whereby robotsthat work on the microscopic level are injected into the human body to cureall manner of human ills. The project is in the experimental stage, butthe professor with cancer is desperate. He maintains he is going to dieanyway, so why not give the nanobots a try? Without the researcher's knowledge,he breaks into the lab and injects the microscopic robots into his bloodstreamwith a hypodermic. <BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>At first all goes well. He tells the researcherwhat he has done, of his incredible surge in energy and that he has neverfelt better in his life. In a matter of days, his cancer is in remission,he no longer needs his glasses, and he is driving his fiance crazy withhis unrelenting sexual drive. <BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>However, the researcher is distressed-- the experiment isn't ready for human trials yet. His potential sponsorshipfor this experiment is already tenous, and if it were known that an unauthorizedexperiment on a human subject was in progress, his research would undoubtedlybe shut down. But, the professor convinces him to secretly monitor and testthe microscopic robots and their activity within the professor's body. <BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>One after another, the tests come outpositively. The nanobots are performing their duties perfectly. The professoris a superman with their assistance. Despite the apparent success, the researcheris still skeptical, so the professor intentionally burns his hand over anopen flame in the lab, and the nanobots go to work to miraculously detectthe damage, and heal the burned hand before their eyes.<BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>The researcher isn't totally convinced,and pushes on with ever more stringent tests. One of the tests forces theprofessor to stay underwater for an extended amount of time. As a reactionto this lack of air, the nanobots begin to make physical changes in theprofessor's body-gills, scales, etc. The professor decides he has made amistake, and begs the researcher to remove the nanobots from his system.<BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>The researcher makes several attempts,but the nanobots resist all efforts of eradication, and instead make theprofessor virtually indestructible. Finally, the researcher is successfulin killing the nanobots along with the professor with an massive does ofelectricity and the ensuing fire which destroys all evidence of the monstrositythe professor has become, the lab and the experiment. <BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>The episode does end on this note, though.The final scene shows the professor's fiancee, despondent over the unexpecteddeath, packing up his apartment. She accidentally drops a framed photographof the two of them, breaking the glass. As she carelessly begins to pickup the pieces, she cuts her finger. Before her eyes, the blood and cut disappear.Because the professor had never told his fiancee of the experiment, andhad cut off their relationship when he saw the direction in which experimentwas heading, it takes a moment to realize that the way she had been &quot;infected&quot;with the nanobots was through their lovemaking. <BR></TT><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="25%"><TT>The story isn't over...<BR><BR></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart3.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></BODY>
