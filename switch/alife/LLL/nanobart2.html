An atom isapproximately one-tenth of a nanometer. In order to understand where Drexler'scoming from, the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; is clarified by Regis inNano. It has been used in basically three ways: </TT><UL><LI><TT>to describe miniature etching operations such as processes usedin computer chips <LI>to describe the effort of building micromachines - better describedas microtechnology <LI>to describe molecular nanotechnology which deals with nanometers insteadof microns </TT></UL><BR><TT>What Drexler describes is molecular nanotechnology. </TT><H2><TT>The Little Black Box </TT></H2><TT>And how would this new technological labor force of the world accomplishthis? Drexler envisions what he calls &quot;exemplar manufacturing-systemarchitecture.&quot; Drexler's description of this system which would takeraw materials and reconstruct them into physical objects. This system islaid out in his text &quot;some four hundred pages of chemical, physical,and computational analysis&quot; and written for scientists and researchers.It is entitled <CITE>Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, andComputation</CITE>. For the layman, Regis quotes Drexler's simplified descriptionof <A HREF="BOX.html">&quot;the box&quot;</A>. This box would be availableto everyone in the world, because the box could reproduce itself as easilyas it could produce any other physical object. <BR><P><CENTER></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart1a.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart3.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
