He sent these samples via DHL to his associates in Belgrade, whosent him back STM scan images. Koruga stated: <BR><BR>&quot;They were fantastic--on one you could see clearly energy concentratedin pentagons; on another, clear images of 5 and 6 member rings of carbonatoms (or orbitals); while the third showed the <A HREF="IH.html">Ih</A>symmetrical basis of C60....It was the first time the human eye had lookedat the molecular structure of a new molecule with atomic resolution.&quot;<BR><BR>Out of this came a proposal for cooperative research between MER and Koruga/Hammeroff.<BR><P><CENTER></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart8.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart10.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
