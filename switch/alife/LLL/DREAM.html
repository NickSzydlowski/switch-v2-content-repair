The place was called Bare (Englishtranslation: Puddles) and was one of only three locations in the villagewhere water could be found. Large wastubs were set up there to hold thewater, and local women came there to do their wash.

One of the suns was in <B>theeast</B> while the other was in <B>the west</B>. The sun in the easternsky was motionless as a point one-third of the field-of-view from the east,toward the center of the viewfield. The sun in the west was located aboutone-fifth of the field-of-view from the west toward the center andd wasslowly moving toward the sun in the eastern part of the sky. All of a sudden,the two suns touched. Although I was eagerly anticipating what would happenthen, at first nothing happened. Then, to my great surprise, the sun whichhad been moving from the west continued to move. At the moment when it <B>covered</B>the other sun, they both turned to blinding bolts of lightning. Lightningstruck the summit of the tallest peak dwarfing the village, and insteadof a thunderclap, a godly voice resounded, &quot;Carbon, 13, 18, 24, 2 becomes3!&quot;<BR><CITE><BR>-Koruga relating his &quot;Carbon Dream&quot; in Fullerene C60<BR><BR></CITE></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart5.html"><IMG SRC="../../../../PageMill_Images/image3.html"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></BODY>
