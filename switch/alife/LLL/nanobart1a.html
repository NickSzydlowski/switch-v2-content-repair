During that time, my investigationshave felt like they were leading me into... <BR><BR></TT><IMG SRC="bucky6.jpg" WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="102" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom BORDER="3"><CITE><TT>A cold world where bodies get preppedfor downloading into data, where seeing means artificial optics, where hearingis listening to the high-speed world of sampler culture, where travelingbecomes a nomadic journey across the MUD (Multiple User Dungeons), and wherecommunication disappears into the high-speed fiber &quot;backbone&quot;of the Internet.</TT> - <TT>Data Trash </TT></CITE><TT><BR><BR>So, my expectations upon embarking on a journey into the netherworld ofnanotechnology, were at first fulfilled. The book, <I>Nano, the emergingscience of nanotechnology: remaking the world - molecule by molecule</I>by,<A HREF="REGIS.html">Ed Regis</A> left me with a vision of the futureI wasn't too sure if I liked. Nano follows the conceptual life of futuristK. Eric Drexler. According to <A HREF="DREXLER.html">Drexler</A>, <A HREF="NANOTECH.html">nanotechnology</A>is the manufacture of objects from the molecular level up. This feat wouldbe accomplished by the manipulation of individual atoms by microscopic robotswhich Drexler calls <A HREF="ASSMBLRS.html">assemblers</A>.&quot;The endresult would be to have 'effectively complete control of the structure ofmatter'.&quot; <BR><BR>Perhaps it was the manner in which Drexler's future was represented by Registhat left me feeling that perhaps obsolesce of the artist was only a matterof years -- and within my lifetime. As I dug deeper, however, I saw a newperspective on artists' relationship with technology. <BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="5"></TT><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart2.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
