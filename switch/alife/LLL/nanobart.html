<HR SIZE="5"><TT>Now art arises when from many notions gained by experience
one universal judgment about a class of objects is produced. -<CITE>Aristotle,
Metaphysics, Book 1, 981a <BR>

</CITE>Leonardo's great ambition in his painting, as well as in his scientific
endeavors, was to discover the laws underlying the flux and processes of
nature...Hence, one may understand Leonardo's insistence, stated many times
in his notes, that all his scientific investigations were merely aimed at
making himself a better painter. - <CITE>Art Through the Ages <BR>
<BR>
</CITE>When mind discovers a generalized principle, permeating whole fields
of special-case experiences, the discovered relationship is awesomely and
elatingly beautiful to the discoverer personally, not only because to the
best of his knowledge it has been heretofore unknown, but also because of
the intuitively sensed potential of its effect upon knowledge and the consequently
improved advantages accruing to humanity's survival and growth struggle
in Universe.<BR>
