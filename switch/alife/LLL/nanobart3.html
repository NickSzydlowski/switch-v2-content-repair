This concept was explored in a recent<CITE><A HREF="OUTERLIM.html">Outer Limits</A> </CITE>episode. The scopeof what Drexler sees ahead is a disease-free world, where lifetimes areextended and where the &quot;complete control of the structure of matter...(is)complete control of human biology.&quot; He also imagines the potentiallynegative effects of this technology if it got into the wrong hands.</TT><BR><P><CENTER><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart2.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart4.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
