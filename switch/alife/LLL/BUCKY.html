He was perhapsthe first to attempt to develop, on a global basis, comprehensive, long-rangetechnological and economic plans designed 'to make man a success in Universe'.He conceived of man as a passenger in a cosmic spaceship -- a passengerwhose only wealth consists in energy and information. Energy has two phases-- associative (as atomic and molecule structures) and disassociative (asradiation)--and, according to the first law of thermodynamics, the energyof the universe cannot be decreased. Information, on the other hand, isnegatively entropic; as knowledge, technology, 'know-how,' it constantlyincreases. Research engenders research, and each technological advance multipliesthe productive wealth of the world community. Consequently, 'Spaceship Earth,'is a regenerative system whose energy is progressively turned to human advantageand whose wealth increases by geometric increments.&quot; <BR><BR>Fuller developed a vectorial system of geometry that he called &quot;Energetic-Synergeticgeometry.&quot; The basic unit of this system is the tetrahedron (a pyramidshape with four sides, including the base), which in combination with octahedrons(eight-sided shapes), forms the most economic space-filling structures.The architectural consequence of the use of this geometry by Fuller wasthe geodesic dome, a frame the total strength of which increases in logarithmicratio to its size.<BR><BR>-quote from <I>Encyclopedia Britannica<BR><BR></I></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></BODY>
