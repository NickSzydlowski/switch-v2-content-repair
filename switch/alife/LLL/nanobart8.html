It led one research team Huffman/Kratshmer, whohad in 1983 produced a &quot;graphite smoke&quot; in trying to solve a problemin astrophysics, to realize what the &quot;junk&quot; they were dealingwith in the smoke was C60. Huffman had produced C60 molecules probably asearly as 1973, but it wasn't until he and Kratshmer read a paper by Smalleyand Kroto in 1985 that they realized what they had, and 1989 until theyactually proved it. What makes the Huffman discovery particularly interestinghas to do with his blind mother's intuitive feelings about her son. Sheknew that her son would discover &quot;something important based on thenumber 60.&quot; Being blind, she counted her steps and her &quot;magicnumber&quot; was 60. Huffman and Kratschmer have gone on to to produce thissolid form of carbon C60 calling it <A HREF="FULLRITE.html">Fullerite</A>and have submitted a patent for the production of <A HREF="FULLERNS.html">Fullerenes</A></TT>.<H2><CENTER><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart7.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart9.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><HRSIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></H2></BODY>
