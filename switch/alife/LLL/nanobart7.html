They both, independently, had begun to doresearch with nanobiology in the 1970's. They met in 1984, and their workas a team is characterized by &quot;and the implementation of knowledgefrom <A HREF="NANOBIO.html">nanobiology</A> to nanotechnology.&quot; Koruga'sinterest lies in research on Fullerenes in science and nanotechnology, andHammeroff's research has focused on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (<A HREF="STM.html">STM</A>).</TT><H2><TT>Buckminsterfullerene </TT></H2><IMG SRC="bucky12.jpg" WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="77" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2"><TT>In <A HREF="1985.html">1985</A> Richard Smalley and HaroldKroto and their team of chemists at Rice University, zapped graphite ina laser vaporization cluster-beam, creating a strange new form of carbon-- Fullerene C60 and called it Buckminsterfullerene. These molecules werehollow, shaped like a soccer ball, and closely resembled Buckminster Fuller'sgeodesic domes -- thus &quot;Buckyballs.&quot; <BR><BR>Based on a pentagonal structure, these molecules exhibited very unusualelectrical properties. Depending on how they were combined with other substances,they could function as an insulator, a conductor, a semiconductor, or asuperconductor.<BR><P><CENTER></TT><HR SIZE="5"><A HREF="nanobart6.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWB.jpg"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart.html"><IMG SRC="bucky8.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="nanobart8.html"><IMG SRC="ARROWF.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR></A><HR SIZE="5" WIDTH="60%"></CENTER></BODY>
