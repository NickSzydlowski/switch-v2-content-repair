The class of computer viruses have given riseto hundreds of programs that self-replicate while having some algorithmicside-effect, which, like their namesakes, is almost always destructive.The class of worms tends to be a bit more autonomous making them even morelife-like than viruses. (Biological viruses, although very much a part ofthe world of life, are not living since they are nothing more than chemicalinstructions without the ability to execute on their own.) <BR><BR><IMG SRC="zee.gif" WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>Network fungi as a class, on the other hand are dedicated neither to self-replicationnor to the destruction of data (yet), because a fungus' key function isassimilation. For a model of this mode of artificial-life we look to realfungi. Fungi exist in many unicellular, multicellular, and symbiotic formssuch as yeasts, mushrooms, lichens, and spontaneous fuzzy growths in therefrigerator. Fuzz is quite typical of fungi because all fungi grow filamentously(by tiny threads) into some substrate while secreting enzymes that helpit break down and absorb organic material. The result, of successful assimilationof organic compounds is, of course, more filamentous growth by which theorganism can attach itself to even more useful material. <BR><BR>A fungus' key function is assimilation. Any program that operates in a similarmode of assimilation and growth can be referred to as a computer or networkfungus. The so called agents or robots that search the World Wide Web forWeb material to link up to could very well be called fungi, but in the genreof artificial-life we're looking for something a bit more organic in itsbehavior and, like real-world fungi, an algorithm that converts the materialbeing absorbed into something else other than what it started as. Figure1 of a fungus infecting a discussion list helps illustrate a primitive example.In this example, the fungal program becomes a subscriber to a listservediscussion list whose individual members distribute information to all othermembers through the listserve e-mail address. The information exchangedcan, typically, only be read via e-mail by members and sometimes can onlybe sent by members as well. The fungus can change all this by convertingto web pages all the e-mail it receives from this list. At the same timethe fungus can open private discussion lists even further by forwardinge-mail it receives from non-subscribers to the list. As you might notice,fungal infections can be both desirable and intrusive. Certainly, as muchactivity as the Web gets now, many ideas along these lines are already beingtried. But the idea of a web fungus invites-- and hopefully welcomes-- unpredictability.For instance, if a significant number of the people interacting with a discussionlist by way of the fungus happen to know HTML, then HTML tags and referencesmay start creeping into discussions to such an extent that browsing thelist by Web would have distinct advantages. In this way, an entire e-maildiscussion list can be converted into an interactive WWW list. <BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://cadre.sjsu.edu/zoo/brew/"><IMG SRC="zoologbtn.gif"WIDTH="375" HEIGHT="63" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1" ALT="Zoo Brew"></A></CENTER><P>Zoolog is directly involved in two such discussion lists: switch@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu(The electronic arts discussion list) and zoo@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu (The artificiallife discussion list). You can subscribe to either by sending an e-mailmessage to listserv@sjsuvm1.sjsu.edu with either: <BR><BR>subscribe switch firstname lastname <BR><BR>or: <BR><BR>subscribe zoo firstname lastname <BR><BR>all by itself in the body of the e-mail message. What is more important,both of these discussion lists will shortly be available through their fungalcounterparts at: http://cadre.sjsu.edu/switch/brew/ and: http://cadre.sjsu.edu/zoo/brew/<BR><BR>So let's see where else the term 'fungus' turns up, but remember: You heardit here first. <BR>Eric <MATTHEWS@sparta.sjsu.edu> <BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="../other_pages/articles.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ1.gif"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Articles"></A><A HREF="../pdq/rinaldo.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ2.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"ALT="Interview"></A><A HREF="http://cadre.sjsu.edu/zoo/"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ3.gif"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Project Page"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/calpg.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ4.gif" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"ALT="Calendar"></A><A HREF="../other_pages/review.html"><IMG SRC="../BUTSQ5.gif"WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Reviews"></A><BR></CENTER></BODY>
