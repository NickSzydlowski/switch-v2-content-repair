        Curator's Statement:<br/>
</p><p>Sharing the belief that the ubiquity of photographic and other technologically produced images--their application and interpretation--is a crucial concern in contemporary art, the four curators completed the selection of an exhibition that, while not intented to be a comprehensive survey, explores a broad range of issues--formal, <q1><q2><q3><strong><a href="../../../switch/switch_v1n1/SFMO/social.html">social</a></strong>,</q3></q2></q1> <q4><q5><q6><strong><a href="../../../switch/switch_v1n1/SFMO/moral.html">moral</a></strong></q6></q5></q4> and technological.  The curators decided to present substantial segments of work by <strong><a href="../../../switch/switch_v1n1/SFMO/fifteenartists.html">fifteen artists</a></strong> who span three generations, from the mid-1950s to the present, and who possess an ability to create art of exceptional visual quality that is combined with a <strong><a href="../../../switch/switch_v1n1/SFMO/blinders-off.html">blinders-off</a></strong>, deeply perceptive grasp of the state of contemporary culture.  <q7><q8><q9>At a time when
there seems not to be a demonstrably dominant tendencey, the line this exhibition traces through the recent past is surely not the only one that might have been drawn.  It is one, however, that we trust will prove to have lasting validity.</q9></q8></q7> </p>

<p>
The fifteen artists in the show were Robert Frank, Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter, Edward Ruscha, John Baldessari, Dan Graham, Martha Rosler, Larry Clark, Jeff Wall, James Coleman, Chantal Akerman, Nan Goldin, Stan Douglas, Cady Noland, Felix Gonzalez-Torres <q7><q8><q9><strong><a href="andMareSpongia.html">and Mare Spongia</a></strong>.</q9></q8></q7>
</p>
<p>
<q7><q8><q9>Mare Spongia is a <strong><a href="performance.html">performance</a></strong>
artist based in New York.  Her work ranges from guerrilla performance to traditional photographic work.  The piece that was in this show is titled, I think I know Where Duchamp's Urinal Is.  My guide came upon it by accident
and it was a pleasant surprise.  If you don't look for this piece you won't see it.  It is both in the Women's and Men's bathrooms.  The bathrooms are located on the ground floor of the museum.  My guide, PDQ, saw the sign in the men's bathroom.  Apparently there was a sign over one of the urinal's that said:  This Is Not Duchamp's Urinal and below it there was a picture of the infamous urinal that Duchamp submitted to the non-juried show of the American Society of Independent Artists in 1917.  The sign and photo are quite small, approximately 3" x 5".  Mare Spongia was included in the show as part of the group of younger artists working with technological media.  Her work is reminescent of Andy Warhol and it challenges the viewer's notions about where it is appropriate to see art.
</q9></q8></q7>
</p>
</p>
<q7><q8><q9>On April 25, 1995 Mare and her cohort Pontificus O.  started the Institute of Invisible Thought.  Their goal was to infiltrate the art world as art critics.  Mare bought a beautiful suit and hit the art scene in high fashion.  She went to every gallery in Soho with an attitude that suggested she meant business.  With the funding Mare and Pontificus had received from friends and sympathetic artists, they started their publication, The Non-Art Art Journal.  "Some forms of technology are cheap, like the photo-copy <strong><a href="machine.html">machine.</a></strong>" </q9></q8></q7>
</p>
<p>
<q7><q8><q9>The first issue of Non-Art Art Journal was dedicated to the Xerox Corporation.  After having been rejected by the art-world, Mare and Pontificus O. quickly moved into the realm of Corporate America.  "The people at Xerox take us much more seriously because money is involved and so is a product.  And it's not my product.  I didn't <strong><a href="invent.html">invent</a></strong> the photo copy machine, I just use it."  </q9></q8></q7>
</p>
<p>
  <q7><q8><q9>"Artists are too busy trying to invent ideas.  There must be some recipe book somewhere that teaches you how to cook ideas.  You take all these <strong><a href="raw.html">raw</a></strong> materials, mix them up,
bake or boil or microwave them and you get an idea.  Or maybe there should be an Idea
Store and you go there and buy an idea."  This quote truly exemplifies Mare's philosophy.  </q9></q8></q7>
</p>

<p>
  <q7><q8><q9>Mare uses very minimal materials in her work.  She recently purchased a chalk board and she writes down her every idea--the ones she is sure belong to her.  On my last visit to her studio, the chalkboard was still totally clean.    </q9></q8></q7>
</p>
<p>
  <q9><q8><q7>I look at art only one way, the mathematical way.  It's a really simple formula.  First you figure out what materials the artist used and you subtract that from the reason why they used the materials, divide the sum by the title and you end up with the sum total which is the idea.  </q7></q8></q9>
</p>
<p>
  <q3>I come at last to death and to the attitude we have toward it.  On this point everything has been said and it is only proper to avoid pathos.  Yet one will never be sufficiently surprised that everyone lives as if no one "knew."</q3>
</p>
<p>
  <q9><q8><q7>This is because in reality there is no experience of death.  Properly speaking, nothing has been experienced but what has been lived and made conscious.  Here, it is barely possible to speak of the experience of others' deaths.  It is a substitute, an illusion, and it never quite convinces us.  That melancholy convention cannot be persuasive.  The horror comes in reality from the mathematical aspect of the event.  If time frightens us, this is because it works out the problem and the solution comes afterward.
</q7></q8></q9>
</p>
<p>
  <q9><q8><q7>One must pay dearly for immortality:  one has to die several times while still alive.
</q7></q8></q9>
</p>
<p>
  <q8><q7>I hate him.  I hate him when I see him.  I hate him when I don't see him.  I hate the idea of him.  It's not his fault that he is what he is and says all that he says.  I just wish that I didn't have to witness his every act of stupidity.  He is so big that there is no getting away from him.  And he grows bigger everyday.  The sight of him insults my entire being.  He has no ideas what it means to be alive.</q7></q8>
</p>
<p>
  <q9><q8><q7>The most spiritual human beings, if we assume that they are the most courageous, also experience by far the most painful tragedies:  but just for that reason they honor life because it pits its greatest opposition against them.</q7></q8></q9>
