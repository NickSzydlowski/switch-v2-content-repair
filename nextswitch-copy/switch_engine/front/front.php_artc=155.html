<p>Electronic sound technology has influenced the development of music in many ways. For example, the emphasis on timbre or sound color in modern instrumental music is often related to experiences and ideas that were developed in electronic music, as is the case with for example the music of Gyrgy Ligeti. On the other hand, timbre was already becoming more and more important in instrumental music, as for example in the music of Edgard Varese (1883-1965). But, significantly, Varese was indeed dreaming of the possibilities of electronic or electroacoustic music - a dream that came true at the end of his life with the composition DÃˆserts (1954). The alternation of instrumental and electronic parts in this composition can be considered as a metaphor for the intertwining of social, cultural and technological factors in the development of techno-cultural phenomena like electronic music. Technology does not determine itself in an inevitable way, but is made by humans, men and women, in a social environment. Nor does technology inevitably determine cultural or social developments. Tech- nology can be used and developed in many different ways. It is important to watch out for the fallacy of technological determinism. When the consequences of technology are presented as inevitable, often interests, discrepancies, disagreements and power relations are concealed. Feminist studies of gender and technology often discover the refrain 'new technologies, old stories': new technologies as vehicles<br/>
for old gender patterns. <br/>
<br/><br/>
In relation to electronic sound technology, I have a nice techno-optimistic dream. Like most dreams, it is not so fantastic at all, and it can be observed in real life to some extent. One of the most important aspects of electronic and digital sound technology, that is, the recording of sound, can not only contribute to the emancipation of timbre, but also to a positive change in the role of the vocalist. And because vocalists are mostly female whereas composers are mostly male, this implies a positive change in musical gender roles.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/>

<!-- Version 1 -->
<br>
The character of performance is overwhelming presence and evanescent process:
impressive at the moment itself, lost afterwards. This contrasts with the
work of the composer: he creates a musical score which lasts in time, after
the composer's death, and which can be multiplied and distributed around
the world. Scores don't vanish the moment they come into existence, but
patiently lie on one's desk to be studied again and again. But scores need
performers to become sounding music; composers essentially need performers,
although they often complain about them. Roughly speaking, composers compose
notes and performers create a subtle play with sound, timbre and timing.
If one looks into histories of Western music and in musicological curricula,
one finds composers and their works, and almost no performers. To a large
extent, this is quite understandable: we still have access, more or less,
to parts of the work of composers - their scores (directing, organizing
and performing were often also part of the work of a composer, and of course
we don't have direct access to these past activities). Performances, that
is, sounding compositions or improvisations, are lost. For example, the
past sound art of past famous singers is lost for ever, but not the scores
of their contemporary composers.
</br>

<br>
Sound recording changes the status of the musical performance. When recorded,
the musical work of a singer is repeatable, distributable and long-lasting,
after the moment of performance and after the death of the singer. It can
be listened to and analysed again and again. Through sound recording, the
music of the singer can be perceived beyond the reach of the singer herself.
Recorded, the creative work of the performer can get a status comparable
to a composition: permanent, reproduceable and authoritative. Moreover,
sound recording technology not only makes it possible to record a performance
of a score or an improvisation, but also to compose directly with sound
(e.g., voice) on tape. With a recording of a performance or an improvisation
or with a tape-composition of her vocal sound, a singer becomes a creator
of a permanent creative art object. Whether she made it on her own or coproduced
it with others, the work of the vocalist is an inextricable and essential
part of a musical piece consisting of recorded vocal sounds. In this kind
of music, the roles of singer and composer are changed or merged. As a (co-)creator
of a permanent recorded object consisting of an interpretation, improvisation
or tape-composition, one can assign the vocalist an authoratitive status
comparable to that of a composer.
</br>

<br>
And indeed, examples of this techno-optimistic dream can be found. Take
for example CD's called 'Maria Callas', 'Kathleen Ferrier', 'Enrico Caruso'
or likewise. On these CD's, not the composers but the singer is presented
as the main figure. And, of course, in pop/rock music some performative
aspects like sound and timing are inextricably part of the recorded product
and the singer is often considered as the main figure. Significantly, in
pop/rock music there is not a standard way of singing - the special sound
of a particular voice is a very important, identifying element. Also for
singer- composers like Joan La Barbara, Diamanda Galas or Laurie Anderson,
sound recording is very important for their work; especially so, because
extended vocal techniques, a special timbre or a special way of speaking
or singing (timing, intonation) are all features wich cannot be notated
adequately and which are essential in their work. In this way, sound recording
technology has contributed to the extension and proliferation of the work
of the (often female) vocalist. (But of course other influences were also
important, for example, the search for new sounds in avant-garde music,
performance art and feminism.)  </br>

<br>

But my dream, although partly come true, is not the only possible effect
of the technology of sound recording. Although the art of vocal performance-interpretation
or improvisation is now available as a lasting object of analysis (for example
for comparing different performances of the same composition, or analysing
an improvisation), musicology is still predominantly concerned with scores,
i.e. the work of composers. And though one can argue that in pop, rock or
avant-garde tape music the work of the composer and the work of the vocalist/instumentalist
are essentially intertwined, the distinction between composer and performer
still lies at the basis of the laws for musical copyrights. Regarding copyrights,
it is the composer who owns most. Moreover, sometimes the work of vocalists
seems to dissappear when it is part of a tape piece. A very significant
example of this is Thema: Ommagio a Joyce (1958) by Luciano Berio. This
composition completely consists of the manipulated voice sounds of Cathy
Berberian, whose special timbre is an important feature of the composition.
But more often than not, she is not mentioned at all in sleeve notes or
musicological studies.
</br>

<br>
Technology studies warn us to watch out for technological determinism. Technological
determinism is a way of thinking which is widespread, and one can perceive
it often in discourses about new technological developments in the arts.
Will the Internet or multimedia change the world or the arts? Maybe changes
will (and already did) occur in relation to these new technologies, but
these changes are not and will not be simple, unambiguous or uniform. Technological
practices are and will be social and cultural sites of contestation and
multiplicity, connected to existing social-cultural practices, patterns
and institutions. Gender patterns turn out to be very persistent, and often
take on new guises in new media. New technologies offer many different possibilities
for change, but also new possibilities for the survival of old structures.
It seems important to me that both tendencies are kept in mind. Both a critical
scrutinity of old and new techno-social-cultural practices and a hopeful
exploration of possibilities for positive change are needed. Thus, it is
important to not only speculate about the future but also to study the past
and the present. In discussions about art and technology, much attention
is paid to the newest and hottest technological developments; but the consequences
of older, very common and very important technologies like sound recording
and sound amplification still deserve much more critical and analytical
attention. In the above discussion above the status of the (female) vocalist
and the (male) composer in tape-music, I have tried to give a glimpse of
an analytical strategy which looks for conservative as well as progressive
tendencies and in which there is room for critical as well as hopeful observations.

<h2><center><strong>Gender and Electronic Music</strong></center>
</h2>

<p>Going to computer music conferences, lectures about electronic music
or hi-fi shops etc., one learns that electronic music<i> (1)</i> is a man's
world. One can react to this in different ways. Here, I will give a limited
overview of some possibilities.<br>
<br>
First of all, one can ignore the fact that most people in the world of electronic
music are male, or at least one can try to do so. Considering the topics
which are raised in conferences, books, journals etc., this is what most
people do. But this is changing a little. Last year, for instance, the International
Computer Music Conference encouraged to submit papers on women and computer
music; and with the ICMC'96, this is again the case. But although there
was a lively discussion about women and computer music at the ICMC'95, only
three papers on this topic were actually presented. And in the programme
of the ICMC'96, I can only find two papers on the issue of women and computer/electroacoustic
music.<br>
<br>
One can ask: why are there so few women in computer music? This is what
Mary Simoni did in her paper at the ICMC '95. The question is related to
questions like: why are there so few women working in the field of (specialized)
technology? why are there so few women working with (the more specialized
aspects of) computers? why are there so few women composers? The answers
are complex. Simoni also gave suggestions for ways to get more women into
computer music. Central here seems the ideal of equality between men and
women. <br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>In her paper at the ICMC'95, Andra McCartney focused on women composers.
She interviewed many Canadian women composers, and gave an overview of the
specific experiences and practices of these women composers. This approach
focuses on the differences women make. McCartney not only reports negative
experiences of women with sexism in electronic music practice. She also
shows interesting positive specific feminine practices of electronic music
(including teaching etc.). <br>
<br>
My paper at the ICMC'95 was not focused on (female or male) composers, but
on the music itself. The subject of this paper was computer compositions
with voice sounds, and the question was: Do male and female voices have
different roles in this type of music? The answer was: yes. First of all,
there are a lot of compositions for live singing female vocalist and tape
or computer, but almost no compositions for live singing male vocalist and
tape/computer. Furthermore, female voices in computer music often sing non-verbal,
melismatic vocal lines, whereas, male voices in computer music tend to speak
more. This is a similar gender pattern as had been found in film (Silverman
1988) and nineteenth- century opera (Poizat, Dame 1994). This paper was
concerned with representations of gender in computer compositions. <br>
<br>
Instead of focusing on composers or compositions, one can also focus on
listeners. This approach is developed by Dame (1994), but she doesn't apply
it to electronic music. Women can, as 'resisting listeners', create different
interpretations and different reception practices of musical pieces.<br>
<br>
A focus on performers would also be possible. I tried to developed this
a little in my papers for the ICMC'95 and ICMC'96. <br>
<br>
Probably, there are many other ways to study women's or gender issues in
electronic music, and I would like to invite anyone whose work in this field
I haven't mentioned, to contact me. <br>
<br>
Last but not least, I think that an important omission in the research regarding
gender issues in electronic music so far, is the topic of men in electronic
music. Why are so many men involved in electronic music? How is electronic
music related to masculinity? Can we find traces or representations of masculinity
or reactions to masculinity in electronic compositions or in hard- and software
used in electronic music? Many more questions can be thought of. Exploring
these topics would give us more insight in electronic music and its practices.
But personally, I first want to focus on female voices in electronic music.
Since electronic music is so much a man's world, it seems a good idea to
me to pay special attention to female aspects. But gender issues are related
to femininity and masculinity, to women and men. Focusing on masculinity
seems to me a very interesting issue for future research. Furthermore, what
is needed urgently, I think, is that men in electronic music also reflect
on their roles, on masculinity and on gender.<br>
