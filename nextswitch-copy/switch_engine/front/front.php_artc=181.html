<br/>
I. What is a MUD? </p><ul><br/>
<li>A MUD is a synchronous (real-time) text based multi-user virtual-<br/>
reality environment on the Internet.<br/>
</li><li>MUDs are widely used on the Internet as interactive role-playing games.<br/>
</li><li>A MUD is a text setting which allows users to interact both with their<br/>
environment and with other users. <br/>
</li><li>MUD = Multiple User Dimension, Multiple User Dungeon, Multiple User<br/>
Domain, or Multiple User Dialogue <br/>
</li><li>MUDs are Constructionist environments in which people build personally<br/>
meaningful artifacts. MUDs place special emphasis on collaboration, encouraging<br/>
construction within a social setting. <br/>
</li></ul><br/>
The original MUDs were adventure games based on the role-playing game, Dungeons and Dragons.  In 1979, the first MUD was written by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle on a DECsystem-10<br/>
at Essex University in England. The initial idea has evolved over the years<br/>
into a client/server architecture. The MUD server manipulates the database<br/>
of objects in the virtual world, is programmable in a language that allows<br/>
one to extend the set of objects, and accepts network connections from clients.<br/>
The client's primary task is to send and receive I/O between the server<br/>
and the user. <br/>
<br/>
The MUD server exists on one machine on the network, while the client is<br/>
typically run by the users on their own machines.   Typically, the MUD server<br/>
presents a virtual space organized into "rooms". A "room"<br/>
in the MUD terminology, corresponds to a place where characters or objects<br/>
may be located. Within a MUD, the primary means of communication  is by talking<br/>
to other people located in the same room. <br/>
<br/>
Recently MUDs have been seen in a new perspective. While they are used most<br/>
often as gaming environments, the software is not constrained to just that<br/>
purpose. Instead, it is possible to program an environment in the MUD that<br/>
is suitable for socializing and communicating. The MUD becomes a virtual<br/>
"place" on the network where people can meet and collaborate on<br/>
various projects. MUDs are organized around the metaphor of physical space.<br/>
One can "talk" to anyone in the same virtual room. Users can navigate<br/>
through and examine a spatially oriented environment, and can communicate<br/>
with other users within the context and confines of the particular setting<br/>
of the MUD. <br/>
<br/>
Socially, MUDs provide users with a grounded situation in which to interact<br/>
with others at near real time speed. In most MUDs characters are anonymous.<br/>
Each user takes control of a computerized persona/ avatar/ incarnation character.<br/>
When a person first logs onto a MUD, he or she creates a character. The<br/>
person selects the character's name and gender, and writes a description<br/>
of what the character looks like. It is possible for a character to be male<br/>
or female, regardless of the gender of the player. In many MUDs, a character<br/>
can also be neuter or even plural. <br/>

<b>II. MUD CATEGORIES: </b><br/>
<br/>
There are many kinds of MUD programs. MUDs are divided into two main categories:<br/>
games and purely social environments. <br/>
<br/>
1) The LP family of MUDs continues the gaming tradition of its predecessors<br/>
based on role-playing adventure games. <br/>
<br/>
2) TinyMUD is a kind of MUD program more socially oriented. MUCK, MUSH,<br/>
and MOO are all variations of TinyMUD. Each is a step away from the game<br/>
atmosphere towards MOO, which is the main type of non-game-oriented MUD.<br/>
<br/>
In 1989, James Aspnes, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University<br/>
created a new type of MUD, called "TinyMUD" which was not an adventure<br/>
game. Instead of spending time killing virtual monsters, participants "work"<br/>
together to "create" a virtual world. The Tiny- and Teeny- family<br/>
of MUDs are usually more social in orientation; the players gather, chat,<br/>
meet friends, make jokes, and discuss different issues. Both LPMUD and MUD<br/>
nearly always refer to a game with some form of combat, while TinyMUD and<br/>
its descendants TinyMUSH, TinyMUCK, and TinyMOO all refer to socially-oriented<br/>
MUDs.<br/>
<p></p><center><hr width="50%"/></center><br/>
<b>III. MUSHes</b> <br/>
<br/>
One descendent of TinyMUD bears the name "MUSH" for "Multiple<br/>
User Shared Hallucination". MUSH is a derivative of the original TinyMUD.<br/>
A MUSH is a place where players can hang out, socialize, program, and build.<br/>
TinyMUSH The second derivative from TinyMUD. TinyMUSH is more efficient<br/>
in some ways than TinyMUD, but ends up being larger because of programmed<br/>
objects. <br/>
