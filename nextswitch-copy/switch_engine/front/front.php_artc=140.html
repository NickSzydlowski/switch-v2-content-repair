<b><strong><a href="../../../switch/sound/articles/interview_ed/SoundCulture.html">SoundCulture</a><em>'</em>96</strong> </b>was the third transpacific festival of contemporary sound practices. The first was in Sydney, the second in Tokyo, and this time it came to San Francisco. Sound Artists, artists, researchers, cultural theorists, presenting organizations, academic institutions, and others working with sound, from all walks of life came to participate <br/>
in the sound events.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<b><strong><a href="../../../switch/sound/articles/interview_ed/Review%20of%20SC.html">SoundCulture'96</a></strong></b> is the only festival of its kind in this country and most of the shows, which took place all over the Bay Area from April 3-13 th, sold out, proving that there is a strong demand for these types of events.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<b><strong><a href="../../../switch/sound/articles/interview_ed/Ed.html">Ed Osborn</a></strong></b>, an active <strong><a href="../../../switch/sound/articles/interview_ed/Sound%20Artist.html">sound artist</a></strong> from Oakland, was the director of <b><strong>SoundCulture'96</strong></b>. <br/>
After receiving his MFA from Mills College in Music Composition with an emphasis on Electronic and Recorded Media, he became interested in installations and working with sound outside of musical forms. His works have been shown throughout North America, Europe and South America. <br/><br/>
<br>
      <p><b><strong>YT: What is SoundCulture?</strong></b><br>
            <br>
            EO: <b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b> means different things to different
            people. The focus of the festival is the way that different cultures work
            with sound outside of the area of music. Music is the most obvious area
            of aural cultural expression, but there is a wide terrain of communication<b>
            </b>and expression that happens in sound and not in the form of music. So
            <b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b> is a broad term that serves to highlight
            some of these different ways of using sound and gives some focus to existing
            sound practices that don't otherwise get much attention. The festival focuses
            on activities in the Pacific Region because there are a number of things
            that happen quite differently than they do in Europe: different ways of
            thinking and different manners of working with sound. When the festival
            was first put together in 1991 it was designed to be a Pacific Region Festival
            and we decided keep it that way for this edition of it. We had a meeting
            of the international committee here during the festival and we talked a
            little bit about expanding into Europe and we decided for the moment not
            to. Mainly it came down to the fact that 1) the Pacific sensibility is a
            special thing which is worth preserving; and 2) although there are a great
            deal of interesting sound activities in Europe, there are already plenty
            of venues for it so they are not hurting for more.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>
            <i><em><strong>SoundCulture</strong></em></i>
            </h2>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: How was SoundCulture<i> </i>developed?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: It was started by a number of artists and organizers in Sydney. In Australia
            there is a particular stream of sound art work that has been developing
            for quite a while, and eventually some of the people involved with it wanted
            to put together a showcase for it. There is also a long-running program
            on ABC radio (Australia Broadcast Corporation) which is the nationwide radio
            network there called "Listening Room." Every week for two hours
            there is a broadcast of all sorts of experimental sound work. So in terms
            of national consciousness there is already something on the air every week,
            and all over Australia you can tune into the program - although I am sure
            it is not one of the higher-rated programs on the radio. So there is a regular
            representation of experimental sound work in a relatively mainstream venue,
            and this has certainly helped to alert a wide audience to the fact that
            this kind of sound work exists and is a flourishing field. So the combination
            of that and the presence of a number of artists doing interesting works
            made a good situation in which to start the festival. At that festival in
            1991 there were people from Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the US, giving
            it the Pacific flavor that it has maintained. A small working group was
            formed at that festival to plan the direction of future editions of <b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b>,
            and it was decided that next ones would be in Japan and then the <a href="Review of SC.html">US</a>.
            So the one in Tokyo happened in '93, and then it was our turn here. Originally
            ours was going to happen last year, but for various reasons it was not going
            to work to get all the organizations involved at some point during '95 so
            we decided to put that off to <a href="Review of SC.html">'96</a>. The
            next one will probably be in New Zealand, but it is not certain yet. If
            it does happen there then it will be '98 or '99.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: How did you get involved in SoundCulture?</strong></b> <br>
            <br>
            EO: I knew some of the people who have been in the previous editions and
            a couple of people who would had been the key organizers here ended up moving
            to Australia. They were not around to organize it, but there was still a
            group of us who were interested in trying to make it happen. We got together
            and started planning about two years ago, a little longer actually. Eventually,
            just to make this run more smoothly, I agreed to be the director so that
            we could be more focused and have one central person who would know what
            was going on. Everything was run on a <b><strong>volunteer</strong></b>    
            basis, and of course that makes it difficult to do things efficiently, but
            with me as the director and some other people taking care of specific things,
            we got everything to happen. We didn't have an office or anything, I just
            ran everything out of my laptop computer.

            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Oh, I thought it was quite successful. I was amazed that most of the
            events were sold out and that there were huge audiences. I don't know where
            they all came from, I have no idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: I think some people found out about it from the web,
                  but I found out about this through a friend, then I checked out the web
                  site which was very helpful during the festival.</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Our web site was informative, but it was not like one of these really
            snazzy web pages or anything like that. There was an article in the S.F.
            Bay Guardian that came out that helped to draw a lot of people in, but I
            think it was also good word of mouth more than anything. A lot of people
            kept telling me that they only kept hearing good things about it, that it
            is a fun festival to be at, with a lot of interesting people and a lot of
            different kinds of work going on. So that sort of kept people interested.
            <br>

            <b><strong>YT: Do you think <a href="SoundCulture.html">SoundCulture</a>
                  changed you somehow?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: It is hard to say, because it is still fairly soon after the festival
            has finished up. I am a lot more organized now than I was before I did this,
            but that just comes out of necessity. The thing I really value about it
            is that an event like this gathers all these interesting people who are
            working in sound. For me that is even more valuable than having the exhibitions
            or concerts - although that is certainly important part of the discourse
            that goes on as well. But it's pretty huge amount of work to get it all
            to happen.

            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: How big was the event?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: When all was said and done we included the work of <b><strong>228</strong></b>
            <strong><b>participants</b></strong> in <b><strong>17 exhibitions, 10 panels,</b></strong> and
            <b><strong>55 performances</strong></b> and <b><strong>other events</strong></b> These occurred
            at <b><strong>33 sites</strong></b> throughout the Bay Area and involved <b><strong>32 presenting organizations.</strong></b>
            It's really huge. I didn't realize that it was so big until I sat down and added it up.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: Didn't you expect things to get this big?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Oh, no. I knew it's going to be big but I thought there were probably
            going to be maybe 40 artists or something. I've never bothered to add anything
            up until a couple of months before it started and then it turned out to
            be a lot more than I had expected.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: Do you have any disappointments, regrets, or something
                  you wish that could</strong> have happened?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: It's hard to say, because a lot of stuff got included. Fairly early
            on when we were planning everything we made a list of different kinds of
            work that we want to have happened and I think they are all included. We
            wanted to have noise bands, something on acoustic ecology, panels, computer
            network stuff, high tech work, instrument building, installations, radio
            pieces, activities for kids, and so on, and there was something from all
            these categories on the festival. I think the only shortcoming is that one
            of the things we tried to do is to find some innovative indigenous sound
            practices from non-Western cultures among the Pacific Islands, Native American
            groups here, or cultures from Central and South America, and our efforts
            didn't yield very much. We had the call for entries translated into Spanish
            and distributed here, in Mexico, and in South America, but nothing came
            back from it. It probably would have been better to have more actively curated
            that area rather than just seeing what showed up in the mail, but that certainly
            would have required more time and resources than we had available to us.
            Even with a few of the <b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b>  organizers having
            good contacts in those areas, we weren't able to find anything that fit
            the bill.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, we had heard about a particular storytelling practice among
            the Chinese Hmong people that involves playing a wind instrument by singing
            into it and dancing at the same time. There is a Hmong community in Bakersfield,
            but of the people there none had maintained this practice enough to feel
            comfortable presenting it to an outside audience. So in that case it meant
            if we wanted to include it in the festival then we would have to find someone
            in China and bring them over here. And there wasn't the money to do that.
            There is also a really interesting artist in Indonesia, Heri Dono, who we
            wanted to bring over, but again there wasn't the money to do that and the
            Indonesian government doesn't pay to send their artists abroad, so we were
            stuck. I think that that was the only thing that was something of a disappointment
            in that it didn't happen. <b><strong>But that was mainly due to lack of
            money, and lack of money is no surprise nowadays. </strong></b> But other
            than that we had a representations of all the different kinds of work that
            we had planned, and I was happy with that.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: During SoundCulture'96, were there any surprises or any
                  successful stories that you want to talk about?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: There were a lot of nice surprises. Projects that looked like they might
            be hard to realize under particular circumstances ended up turning out very
            well. Kathy Kennedy's piece which was held at the Town Center Mall in Corte
            Madera took on a lot of different transformations during the course of the
            planning. Originally it was going to be with a choir and it was going to
            be a slightly different piece in a different location, then a choir couldn't
            be found. So then Public Art Works (the organization producing that event)
            found a site in the mall where something could happen. When they told me
            I thought, "A shopping mall? Well okay, whatever." Shopping malls
            are usually pretty deadly places, but I thought the piece worked really
            well in the site. So that was a really good surprise. Also I thought that
            the panel presentations on "Acoustic Ecology" at Headlands Center
            for the Arts were pretty good because there were whole range of work that
            was represented there. We also got Negativland to perform at the Trocadero
            Transfer, which I was happy about. That performance looked kind of dicey
            for a while because of logistical requirements, but it got pulled together
            really well. Since Negativland has been doing their wonderful show on KPFA
            for years, they are at the forefront of appropriation practices, and they
            have had a large influence on contemporary sound practice, I wanted to make
            sure that they be included in the festival. If <b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b>
            had happened here without them, it would have been a really serious omission.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: Are you going to get involved in the next SoundCulture
                  event? Can you tell us anything about it?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Since I am on the International Committee, I help keep things running
            from this end (the US) as much as I can. But because this is a festival
            that moves around from place to place, I am not really going to be doing
            whole a lot for the next one so far as I know. <b><strong>It will be probably
            be New Zealand in '98 or '99</strong></b> , but it's not certain yet because
            the people there haven't committed to organizing it yet. I know there are
            some people that are meeting there about it sometime later this month. They
            are going to be talking about it to see how it looks, and they will probably
            be looking at all the same issues that we did when we started two years
            ago.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the things that I imagine that they'll try to do is to find one organization
            to take on the project in-house. When were first talking about doing the
            festival, we wanted to have an existing organization to do exactly that.
            But while the organizations we approached about this were all interested
            in participating in the festival, none of them wanted to take on the responsibility
            for organizing a big project like this. <b><strong>Because the funding has
            gotten so peculiar lately, taking on something big like this is, quite understandably,
            just asking for trouble.</strong> </b> Ultimately, not having the event centered
            at one site worked very well in terms of the overall contour of the event,
            but it did make it very hard to keep everything organized properly.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: Is there anything that you particularly want to mention
                  about SoundCulture?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Well, there was hardly any budget for the event. For the amount of money
            we had raised, we were planning far too many events. In that situation it
            would have been eminently sensible to have just given up, given the money
            back, and just forgotten about it. But it's a credit
            to everyone involved that they stuck with it, put in a lot of time and energy,
            and made it happen. <b><strong>It's really a miracle that something this
            large could happen given what the funding situation for the arts is right
            now.</strong> </b>There is also a reluctance among arts organizations and
            funding agencies around here regarding involvement with large festivals.
            This is a result of what happened with Festival 2000 in 1990. Festival 2000
            was designed to be San Francisco's equivalent to the LA Festival: a big,
            cutting-edge, multi-cultural arts festival. It was supposed to designate
            San Francisco as the art place to be for the 21st Century, and there were
            a large number of arts organizations and funders involved. But it was badly
            managed and they didn't have as much money as they really needed, so after
            one week of a three-week festival they closed it down. And this left a lot
            of performers unpaid and a number of funders and organizations that had
            done a great deal of work for the event with nothing to show for it. So
            after that there exists an understandable reluctance for any of these organizations
            to get involved with large events. So although <b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b>
            wasn't planned to be as large as it turned out, it grew big because there
            was a lot of interest among the organizations in making it happen and it
            seemed feasible to do with their help. On the other hand, I don't recommend
            this as a model for making a festival occur. <b><strong>Trying to stretch
            a tiny amount of money into covering lots of things basically means that
            a lot of people have to work very hard and end up getting burned out.</strong>
            </b> But overall it's a good thing that happened and good to know that a
            lot of people were willing to work hard to make it go.

            <h2><i><em><strong>Sound Artist</strong></em></i></h2>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: Do you consider yourself a sound artist?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Yes, but that title doesn't say very much about what I do. It says something
            about technique but it doesn't say anything about the work. In addition,
            the term doesn't mean a great deal to anyone who isn't already familiar
            with the field, so even though I use the term to describe what I do, it
            is of limited usefulness. The vagueness of the term points to the fact that
            the field isn't as recognized as it should be and that there isn't a formalized
            practice of it. The variety of forms in which artists are using sound preclude
            a solid definition of the field. This is related to the fact that most arts-presenting
            institutions are usually ill-equipped to deal with sound art - no surprise
            since almost none of them were designed for it. <b><strong>Gallery spaces
            are generally set up to look at art but not to listen to it.</strong> </b>
            In those spaces there are often problems with sound from one piece bleeding
            into another, or the sonic qualities of an exhibition space aren't suited
            for sound work - the flat walls cause lots of reverberation which may not
            be desirable. In addition, the structures of institutions that present music
            or performance can sometimes also be a detriment to the presentation of
            sound art. Sometimes a theater-type space is all that is available and that
            is sometimes not suitable to particular types of sound work. In addition,
            sound art performances are occasionally scheduled on concerts with music.
            Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, at the very least it is difficult
            for a listener to change their way of listening from musical habits to other
            modes in the middle of a concert. So generally it is difficult for those
            kinds of institutional structures to accommodate the variety of work that
            is found in the field of sound art. All the organizations that participated
            in <b><strong><a href="Review of SC.html">SoundCulture</a> </strong></b> were,
            to their credit, very open-minded about all of these issues. <b><strong>But
            even the most generous program director is going to think twice before rebuilding
            their gallery space to handle a special project, no matter what it is.</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            In some senses, the closest ideal institution is radio because it is experienced
            only as sound and listening to radio tends to be a personal kind of experience.
            But of course there are no visuals with radio, so that knocks out a great
            deal of possible work right there. That aside, radio is a very good medium
            for sound art. The main problem lies in acquiring radio space for experimental
            projects, since all of the commercial and non-commercial broadcast channels
            available are very tightly formatted. And that formatting has set up a rather
            rigid set of expectations among both programmers and audience about what
            the possibilities of radio are. So spaces on radio that are open to experimental
            work are not that common. Fortunately for <b><strong><a href="Review of SC.html">SoundCulture</a></strong></b>,
            we had the cooperation of KPFA, which offers much more space for experimentation
            than any other radio station around here except maybe for the unlicensed
            radio transmitters.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>So it's an art form that takes on a wide variety of formats,
            but one of the artifacts of that is that doesn't fit very well into any
            existing institutional frameworks.</strong></b> In pursuing my own career,
            I have lost count of times when a gallery director would say, "Well,
            that's very interesting but you know, we never had a sound piece here before
            and we wouldn't know what we would do with it." It's not really that
            hard to deal with but it is true that galleries generally are not set up
            for it. I had a review recently of an exhibition I did in Michigan where
            the writer said that sound did not belong in gallery or museum settings;
            he missed the fact that those places are not designed for sound in the first
            place. But that review did make clear two things. <b><strong>One, there is a real need for education and the inclusion of
            sound in the standard arts practices and two, there is likely to be a great
            deal of resistance to the form in part because by its nature it slips across
            the boundaries and categories that everyone is used to in visual arts culture.</strong></b> Since
            <b><strong><a href="SoundCulture.html">SoundCulture</a></strong></b> 
            highlighted the fact that sound art is a solid field, hopefully it will
            help to overcome some of this resistance and garner the area a bit more
            attention. As that happens, describing oneself as a sound artist will not
            be quite such a novelty, nor will it lead to the kinds of puzzlement that
            I am now used to encountering.

            <h2><i><em><strong>Parabolica</strong></em></i></h2>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: I saw your exhibition at Center for the Arts Yerba Buena
            Gardens. Can you tell me about the piece? How did you come up with the title
            "Parabolica"?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: <b><strong>"Parabolica"</strong></b>  is an Italian word for
            parabolic, and a parabolic curve is a particular form that can be described
            mathematically. In Italy, there is an automobile race track, Monza, in which
            one of the curves is named Parabolica because of its shape; it's actually
            the last one before the finish line on the track and it is well-known in
            automobile racing culture. I watch car racing obsessively, it's just about
            my only interest in sports, so there is always a lot of generally useless
            information about it rolling around in my brain. Once in a while, as with
            this piece, something relating to it makes its way into a project I am doing.
            The statistical form of the bell curve is a parabola. Since measurements
            of a great variety of human activities show up as a bell curve when plotted
            out and that some of the studies that show this have ugly implications about
            the distribution of skills and intelligence across social groups, it seemed
            that the parabolic form of the bell curve could be used as a reference both
            to the Darwinistic tendencies in human culture generally and, if sports
            are viewed as a simplified abstraction of these tendencies, to the specific
            forms of competition found in them - car racing being one example. As the
            curve on this particular track is right before the finish line (it's the
            last spot for the cars to pass one another before reaching it) and discrepancies
            in performance between automobile racing teams is largely a result of unequal
            access to financial resources, the title seemed apt in referring to the
            inequities that affect outcomes resulting from human performance and capabilities
            on all levels.
            <br>
            <br>
            The piece itself is made from a materials used to build a model train set,
            and an engine that pulls a special car equipped with a speaker circulates
            around it continuously. The track is designed as a loop with one part of
            it splitting into many different paths that feed back and forth between
            one another. Each time the train goes around the track, the switches that
            determine what route the train will take get reset randomly so that it takes
            different one through this matrix of paths. While the train starts out each
            loop at the same point, it will end up at one of five different segments
            each time around depending on how the switches happen to be set. Because
            of the way that the paths are laid out, the train will take the routes through
            the middle more often than it will the ones on the inner and outer part
            of the loop. So over time the train is describing with its motion the form
            of the bell curve.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the train does this it broadcasts sounds of people talking about making
            decisions and plans, describing confidence and certainty, and sounds of
            highly stressed mechanical systems. In the piece it is possible to hear
            the sounds of trains and racing cars and some other machinery. There are
            also sounds referring to human activities like applause, laughter, crowds
            of people talking, and sounds referring to forces of nature. So there are
            aural representations of human and natural energies being expended, all
            referring to some notion of determination. As these sounds are heard, the
            vehicle carrying them (the train) is illustrating a tendency towards the
            average, its course determined at random and beyond its control.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: Some of the sound are hard to hear especially when people
            are talking. Are they speaking in English language?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: Yes, it is in English. The sounds that the train broadcasts are picked
            up from the rails, and as the train rolls along them dirt accumulates on
            the track. The more dirt there is, the fuzzier the sound; it's a problem
            we've been battling with for the course of the exhibit. It's equivalent
            to playing a vinyl record: the more it is played the less clear it becomes.
            Even when we clean off the track and wipe off everything down, it gets dirty
            again very quickly; it's a technical shortcoming of the piece. But the idea
            of the sound actually coming through the rails is important. You've probably
            seen an image of someone putting their ear to a train track or done it yourself
            to hear if a train is coming. <b><strong>Sound vibrations travel better
            through solid materials that they do in air, therefore an "ear to the
            ground" will allow listening at a greater distance, and I wanted to have this idea present in the piece.</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: What did inspire you to do this project?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The original inspiration for the piece occurred when was when I was looking
            at a train track and realized that they are often used to carry electricity,
            so they could be used to carry audio signals. Since they are designed to
            allow something to move along them (a train car), this system could be used
            to provide an audio signal to a moving speaker, and having a moving sound
            source that is possible to have some control over is something that I've
            been interested in doing for a long time. With model trains there
            is a mechanical system already in place designed to pick up signals from
            the rails (to provide power to the engines), so I had to modify it a little
            bit to get audio, but it wasn't difficult. So that's how it started. It
            took a while after that to figure out how to use this system in a way that
            made sense as a piece, but eventually it all came together.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><strong>YT: I have noticed that the rail sways slightly which is
            very nice.</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: It's sort of hypnotizing. Since the track is suspended, it sways back
            and forth a little bit when the train goes around. Originally I was planning
            to have supports coming up from the floor to hold everything in place, but
            that would have been too impractical. When we were putting it together and
            trying to figure out how to hold it off the floor, the crew at Center for
            the Arts suggested to hang it. At first I didn't think that it was going
            to work, that there would need to be too many cables hanging down from the
            ceiling, but we only needed five so it worked out very well. The whole staff
            at Center for the Arts was very helpful in putting the show together, I
            certainly couldn't have done it all myself. They always made sure that I
            got what I needed to complete the project. The shape of the track is wavy
            in order to emulate the roads found in Dr. Seuss's books. I wanted the look
            of those curvy, one-lane roads with no guardrails that the characters are
            always driving pointy little cars around on.

            <br>
            <b><strong>
            YT: Are you doing anything right now? Do you have any plans for future?</strong></b>
            <br>
            <br>
            EO: There are a couple of projects that I am working on now that I had to
            put on hold during the organizing of <a href="SoundCulture.html"><b><strong>SoundCulture</strong></b>.
            </a> One is a project working with blind people in San Francisco. I got a
            grant to develop a project working with the Rose Resnick Lighthouse for
            the Blind and Visually Impaired. It's a community-based project, and I am
            working with them to develop an aural portrait of some of the people in
            it. Once we get the audio material together it will be played through a
            very specialized locating system for the blind that is being installed in
            a number of different locations in San Francisco. The plan at the moment
            is for it to be installed in Yerba Buena Gardens when the whole system gets
            put in place there. Since it is a public site, it has to be approved by
            lots of city agencies and the whole process is very slow, but that's the
            way it is. So the project probably won't be done until next year sometime.
            I am also working on a project in Seattle which involves a bus shelter at
            the University of Washington. We are still talking about how that's going
            to go, and since that also is a public project, it will take a while too. <b><strong>"Parabolica" </strong></b>
            will be shown in Berlin later this year, so I'll be going over to set it up and maybe doing some other
            projects when I am there as well.
