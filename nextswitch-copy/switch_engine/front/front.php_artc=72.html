<p> <br/>
        When I was a child, my parents took me to the Spring May shows at the local<br/>
museums, which at the time were the Akron Art Institute and Cleveland Museum of<br/>
Art in Northeast Ohio, USA.  These exhibitions were popular showcases for local<br/>
talent, and were adjudicated by the museum staff and regional art faculty.  As<br/>
a matter of passing, none of these shows exist at the turn of the millennium,<br/>
having been supplanted by more profitable touring exhibitions of works which<br/>
are more popular with the mainstream public.  Although I strained to see over<br/>
the platforms to see some of the works in the shows as a child, I dimly<br/>
wondered about those who selected the art in the gallery(1).  This was probably<br/>
the first inkling about a curiosity that would evolve into an erstwhile<br/>
avocation from my primary practice as a conceptual artist to explore art<br/>
curation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the thirty or so years that I have been experiencing the product of<br/>
curatorial practice, as well as the decade or so in which I have been involved<br/>
in the process of curation, the traditional models of this cultural practice<br/>
are being held circumspect in light of the coming of various media<br/>
technologies.  The traditional model of curation, in its evolution since the<br/>
17th Century, centers itself around the ‘expert’ opinion of the curator as<br/>
educated connoisseur and archivist of various works.  In so doing, the curator<br/>
determines the work’s cultural value, as well as in present days, their mass<br/>
entertainment value, which is equally important in the era of ubiquitous free<br/>
market democracy (at least in most of the Western world).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An important aspect of the process of curation and exhibition is the matrix of<br/>
power issues and legitimacy that arises in the act of selection, organization<br/>
and archival.  Traditionally, the legitimization of the work or the institution<br/>
itself does not come from populist or democratic impulses, but from oligarchic<br/>
materialist practices originated with the birth of the museum.   The focus of<br/>
the museum and the archival of ‘significant’ cultural artifacts have been<br/>
determined by oligarchic hegemony issuing forth from centers of capitalist,<br/>
academic, and political power, and as such the museum is often termed as a<br/>
‘materialist cathedral’ (2).   Such imperatives are reflected in the names of<br/>
various museums, such as Whitney, Guggenheim, Getty, Kimbell, and Walker (3). <br/>
The result of this ‘top-down’ approach to culture has resulted in the curator’s<br/>
tack of thematically organizing bodies of work, frequently with little<br/>
collaborative interest in the material. But with the advent of the Internet,<br/>
the cultural centrality in cultural production of the museum is being called<br/>
into question by independent curators who are utilizing alternative<br/>
configurations of gallery space or abandoning it entirely.  This resituation of<br/>
the gallery as problematic cultural space has been foregrounded in many ways,<br/>
including the aforementioned elision of the institution and the opening of the<br/>
curatorial process to allow for collaboration as well as surrender of control<br/>
to the artists.  The traditional structures mentioned here of the curator as<br/>
centralized arbiter for the museum is, by and large, not conducive (although<br/>
there are exceptions) to the collaborative process between curator and artist<br/>
in shaping the nature of a given exhibition.  That is, unless a given artist<br/>
has reached such fame and prestige that that artist may have the ability to<br/>
dictate parts of the exhibition to the curator.  One may question whether this<br/>
is collaboration per se, in that I define such as the process in which the<br/>
artist and curator, after the initial selection of work or agreement to show,<br/>
work in a process that allows both to shape the final outcome of the<br/>
exhibition. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the 1990’s, the coming of the Internet and other distributed media has<br/>
produced marked cultural effects upon technological society and the Western<br/>
world.  The primary effect germane to this discussion is the ‘levelling’ effect<br/>
on society that the Internet has had (4).  Although this is not as prevalent as<br/>
in the times up to the late 90’s when more intranets, and even the Internet 2<br/>
initiative was founded, the implication of internet culture was that given the<br/>
proper e-mail address, the average artist could communicate with leading<br/>
curators, given that they had time or the desire to read them.  In addition,<br/>
the advent of the World Wide Web fostered in many the sense of communal sharing<br/>
of cultural data, whether art, baby pictures, or new essays, and so on (5). <br/>
The materialist impulse of the museum was brought into question with the coming<br/>
of net.art, although such gallery practices are still extant. Groups such as<br/>
art collectives would join in practice through the Internet despite being in<br/>
disparate locales.  And lastly, the rise of Internet culture, in the<br/>
proliferation of interactive works and collaborations, question the nature of<br/>
institutional boundaries and the power relations contrasting those individuals<br/>
possessing material in contrast to those with intellectual legitimacy. Such<br/>
shifts (the changing of capital, societal ‘levelling’) have inspired many<br/>
projects in which the curators have entered a more interactive process of<br/>
collaboration with their artists that are far different than the traditional<br/>
‘collaborations’ evident in the brick and mortar analogues of the traditional<br/>
museum.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b class="et2">Collaboration in contemporary curatorial practice</b><br/>
<br/>
The collaborative model in contemporary exhibitions has been more located<br/>
within the genre of Net.Art than anywhere else, not surprising when considering<br/>
the model of interaction implied by distributed network culture. Although not<br/>
always held to, the ideal prototype of the Internet community was that of<br/>
sharing and collaboration, as popularized in the mass media by early e-pundits,<br/>
such as Barlow, Rheingold, and Negroponte.  The relatively ‘flat’, rhizomatic,<br/>
or egalitarian social terrain of the early World Wide Web made for an<br/>
atmosphere where savvy artists with even an elementary knowledge of search<br/>
engines and access to the right trade magazines could find the arts ‘scene’. <br/>
Online forums were popular as components of online exhibitions, such as the<br/>
Walker Art Center’s ‘Shock of the View’(6) and ‘EATList’ (7), which almost<br/>
seemed to inspire its own sense of egalitarian debate (providing you had<br/>
Internet access and the knowledge of the site, which is another issue).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A brief note should be said in the contrast in constituency and content between<br/>
the exhibition lists like EAT and SotV and online organs like Rhizome and<br/>
thingist.  First, the former organs exist in a limited timespan; as the latter<br/>
are of an ongoing nature.  Also, the focus of the exhibition list is<br/>
topic-driven in contrast to the community lists’ open forum format.  However,<br/>
of note is the nature of communication in these forums as more artists have<br/>
became more familiar with the Net.  For example, earlier events ensured a sort<br/>
of gentrification of the audience, as primarily only a sort of ‘initiated’<br/>
would have the combined knowledge of the technology, the places where the<br/>
events would occur that acted as a kind of cultural filter.  As time has<br/>
progressed, a wider audience has become aware of the lists (8), and various<br/>
artists have chosen to use the lists as a form of collaborative medium in which<br/>
they test the relative sensitivity to noise (spam).  However, this is only<br/>
relevant to the nature of the online community, which is a framework for<br/>
curatorial collaboration.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Steve Dietz’ Art Entertainment Network at the Walker Art Center (9) is one of<br/>
the few examples of a major online exhibition which encouraged a form of<br/>
collaborative curation.  Although centralized in regards to the hierarchical<br/>
nature of the curatorial vision in that Dietz/Walker, the vision for the<br/>
exhibition was that of a rotating archive.  This ever-changing model would<br/>
create a curatorial model that reflected the dynamic state of online art<br/>
practice, and serve as a portal for those wishing to see a broad spectrum of<br/>
online works.  The curatorial model for this exhibition was quite traditional<br/>
in that the selection or commission of works was basically located around a<br/>
single curator, although the dynamic nature of the show allowed for a bit of<br/>
interplay with the artists and the curator. In addition, the inclusion of the<br/>
online art in a gallery installation contained within the concurrent “Let’s<br/>
Entertain” exhibition in the form of a screen embedded in a revolving door<br/>
allowed the gallery visitor to scroll (stroll?) through the works. The<br/>
recontextualization of the works in the gallery through the creatively<br/>
positioned portal allowed some curatorial collaboration in the repurposing of<br/>
the works in regard to their viewing context. Both the breadth of the exhibit<br/>
and the doorway metaphor for the gallery portal alluded to a vision of openness<br/>
and greater inclusion that was refreshing in institutional shows.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although the AEN provided a relatively open forum for new media art, it was<br/>
still closely bound to a traditional curatorial model made broader by the lack<br/>
of physical limitations made possible by the Internet.  The other end of the<br/>
spectrum would arguably include the works that allow free participation within<br/>
a curatorial project with only a topical guideline as shaping metaphor. Two<br/>
process-based exhibition spaces that hint at this procedural approach, and thus<br/>
hint at the potential for dynamic exhibition spaces, are Bonnie Mitchell’s<br/>
“Merging Identity”(10) and Ed Stastny’s sito.org.(11)  "Merging Identity" was a<br/>
World Wide Web art installation that allowed individuals to collaboratively<br/>
assemble texts and images around the metaphor of bodily experience.  In this<br/>
case, the installation was designed as a collaborative event, but Merging<br/>
Identities, through its metanarrative based on the central theme created a<br/>
curatorial focus for the participating artists.  Also of note was that the<br/>
installation/exhibition was archived over time to document the changing<br/>
expressive configurations of the show.  In contrast with the AEN, Merging leapt<br/>
from a dynamic set of curated works to a dynamically self-organizing body of<br/>
work based on general criteria.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another dynamically user driven collaborative curatorial model lies within the<br/>
sito.org website.  Similar to the Exquisite Corpse approach made popular by the<br/>
Surrealists, the SITO site contains a number of ongoing works based on the<br/>
general criteria of using previously extant work in a sense of free<br/>
association.  An example of this is the GridCosm, in which a square grid of<br/>
nine squares is defined with the center field consisting of a ‘seed’ image from<br/>
which artists reserve and upload their own additional images until the grid is<br/>
completed, at which time the completed grid is compiled to form the central<br/>
square of the next GridCosm level.  At this time, GridCosm has existed for over<br/>
five years, and consists of over 800 levels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It might be wise to consider whether this author might be conflating<br/>
collaborative projects with collaborative curatorial practices.  Two key issues<br/>
that come to mind that might clarify the issues at hand are those of<br/>
institutional legitimation and artistic quantifitcation of works.  Mitchell’s<br/>
work was inscribed within the gallery of the SIGGRAPH festival, sito at an<br/>
independent website.  The objectifiying power of the museum was somewhat<br/>
present in the case of Merging Identities in its location within the gallery,<br/>
but surely not in the case of SITO.  As works per se, each site was seen more<br/>
as a discrete project than an exhibition of works in itself.  The argument of<br/>
this author is that both exhibit elements of curatorial objectification of<br/>
works in the interstitial quantification and archival of works at discrete<br/>
periods.  What is at stake is the clarification of creative intent in how the<br/>
curator is defined; in the case of the AEN, the role of curator is clear, in<br/>
the two aforementioned works, the curatorial impulse is better described as a<br/>
parametric/algorithmic guidance of a general process.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another example of an algorithmic curatorial process is evident in works that<br/>
place the database in the position of metanarrative artwork.  Martin<br/>
Wattenberg’s Idealine at the <a href="front.php_artc%3d70.html">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>’s Artport (12) asks artists to submit information documentary information into a database for use by his JAVA applet that takes the resulting information and maps it by genre,<br/>
distribution and time.  Users of the applet then are offered access to the database of submitted works. Although this project has the potential for<br/>
open-endedness, Idealine also exhibits aspects of traditional curatorial metastructures that combine with the database data to create a work that could be perceived as artwork and curatorial tool in that it organizes the work into<br/>
a sort of broadly-defined ‘exhibition’ of sorts.  However, Idealine also could<br/>
be argued as a work of online information design rather than a discrete<br/>
‘artwork’ as such, and writers such as <a href="front.php_artc%3d65.html">Manovich</a> are considering whether there<br/>
can be an art of the database. <br/>
<br/>
Another work that is not curatorial per se, but brought up in conversation (13)<br/>
as to whether it constituted a form of curatorial practice, is the case of the<br/>
RTMark Mutual Fund System (14).  Designed as a clearinghouse for the<br/>
brainstorming and dissemination of corporate subversion projects and the<br/>
subsequent pairing with funding and labor, this net.artwork of sorts is<br/>
considered by its creators more of a fulfillment of the potential for<br/>
organizing social activism on the net.  The system acts as a database<br/>
organizer, categorizing new ‘products’ after their submission to the site, at<br/>
which time there is the dissemination and promotion of said projects in the<br/>
mass media.  If you consider the decentralized executive administrative<br/>
functions of the RTMark group proper in relation to the organizational function<br/>
of the projects, sponsors, and workers, one could posit that there exists a<br/>
sort of dynamic curatorial model within the system. However, the concept does<br/>
not quite fit the idea of curation as the screening of projects is not<br/>
necessarily art related in scope.  In addition, RTMark does not necessarily<br/>
seek to exhibit a body or work within an art context, but to promote actions of<br/>
civil intervention in the mass media. Although RTMark in itself is not a<br/>
curatorial model, it presents structural possibilities for potential net.art<br/>
exhibitions in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b class="et3">PERSONAL EXPERIMENTS</b><br/>
<br/>
The projects mentioned to this point have been either exhibited models that<br/>
were closely related to traditional models of extant curatorial practice, or<br/>
those which radically depart from same, and at this time have only explored<br/>
polar opposites of our discussion.  To consider the range of possibilities in<br/>
the rethinking of curatorial practice, I would like to offer two of my<br/>
exhibitions, as well as works by independents like Anne-Marie Schleiner.<br/>
Although my experiments in collaborative curation have been fairly<br/>
traditionalist in form, each has diverged progressively with each iteration,<br/>
and frequently by accident.  This arc of experimentation began with the 1999<br/>
Through the Looking Glass show in Cleveland, Ohio (15) to the current<br/>
(Re)distributions (16) show, which is in its ‘active’ phase until February 1,<br/>
2002.  Earlier projects are not of interest here, as they were purely<br/>
traditionalist events that operated solely under the usual call and response<br/>
model of juried exhibitions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Through the Looking Glass was held near Cleveland, Ohio, and lasted one year<br/>
after on the Internet.  The exhibition began as a ordinary print exhibition<br/>
between myself and Northeast Ohio digital artist Jerry Domokur at the Beachwood<br/>
Center for the Arts.  In early conversation with the center’s directors while<br/>
organizing the event, an interest for a broader project was expressed so that<br/>
the Cleveland area could be introduced emergent forms of electronic art,<br/>
including net.art.  At that time, Domokur and I decided that this would be an<br/>
excellent opportunity, which was a chance to shape a traditional show of<br/>
digital art into one more representative of contemporary practice through<br/>
rather the net-topian ideals of using communications technology as a tool for<br/>
synergy between artists.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The project, as in the case of many that incorporate Internet strategies in<br/>
their construction, evolved greatly from conceptualization to execution. There<br/>
is little to say of the initial stages of planning of the event; there was only<br/>
enough funding to handle the rental of computer and projection equipment.  And<br/>
in a rather ordinary fashion, a standard call for works went out on the<br/>
Internet.  But by the end of the initial planning stages, an interesting<br/>
pattern had emerged. Apart from the invited artists, such as <a href="front.php_artc%3d66.html">Bookchin</a>, Cheang,<br/>
Verostko, Rees, and the nearly 300 works garnered from the raw call, some of<br/>
the artists began entering in a round table curatorial discussion.  Most<br/>
notable of these were textile artist W Logan Fry and mixed media printmaker<br/>
Jerry Domokur who began forwarding information on numerous works from around<br/>
the world. In addition, Machiko Kusahara made recommendations from the Digital<br/>
Image group in Japan, which resulted in the acceptance of about ten or so works<br/>
&gt;from that group, which broadened the Asian involvement in the show immensely.<br/>
During its development, the event had taken on a ‘cellular’ curatorial model in<br/>
which various individuals working under the central premise of the exhibition<br/>
worked semi-autonomously to assemble works for the exhibition. The result was a<br/>
survey of over eighty artists and scholars’ works describing the state of<br/>
technological arts highlighting material created on every continent of the<br/>
globe, including Antarctica.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although the loosened curatorial model (which was never made explicit) worked<br/>
well, the actual shape of the body of works left something to be desired.  In<br/>
casual conversation with Dietz of the Walker, a common concern for the nature<br/>
of the show as survey was made manifest.  The fact that the exhibition was<br/>
designed as an introduction for the people of Cleveland to new genres, as well<br/>
as challenging of institutional boundaries through internet-based independent<br/>
curatorial practices, one problem remained.  TTLG served its pedagogical<br/>
function, but did not address any central genre, which was becoming more<br/>
important as surveys of work were about to become more widespread.  The next<br/>
experiment in curation was to center on the nascent genres of PDA and<br/>
Information Appliance art, to take place in Q3 2001<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to the emergent nature of the curatorial format that revealed itself<br/>
with the TTLG show, the PDA/IA show, entitled (re)distributions was to embody<br/>
the first real conscious departure from the traditional curatorial process. <br/>
Instead of the usual invitation/call/response model, the plan for acceptance<br/>
accounted for the very early stage of development for most of the pieces, and<br/>
did not have a cutoff date, but a date when works would begin acceptance.  From<br/>
that date, works would be judged on various metrics until the final cutoff<br/>
date, two weeks before the end of the exhibition.  In reflection after the<br/>
beginning of the exhibition, the reality was that works that showed technical<br/>
virtuosity while showing conceptual engagement with the subject were selected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The result of this model was mixed.  Because of technical issues, some artists<br/>
asked for my collaboration in creating their work, as they believed that I was<br/>
creating work on these platforms at an advanced level.  In general, this level<br/>
of expertise was no better than theirs, and the obvious breach of ethics was<br/>
problematic at best.  Suffice it to say that all such requests were politely<br/>
refused.  The next oddity that arose from this model was the fact that as the<br/>
time for the exhibition to begin, almost no one had actually decided to finish<br/>
his or her work or essay.  If this effect had not been corrected, upon opening<br/>
the gallery would be empty in the absence of a concrete deadline. At the time<br/>
of this writing, the iterative curatorial process has continued with only one<br/>
or two updates, primarily due to delays caused by the cultural effects<br/>
resulting from the WTC explosions on 9/11/2001, but is planned to continue the<br/>
full six-month process.  An accretion of works that built on extant works in<br/>
the exhibition has been presented, but conversely, the logistical support<br/>
required for the event is higher than that for more traditional models.  This<br/>
is due to the frequent updates to the site as well as ongoing review of works. <br/>
From this experience, this process, while viable, is not recommended for<br/>
smaller staffs.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="et2">Snow Blossom House</b><br/>
<br/>
Anne-Marie Schliener’s June 2001 Snow Blossom House (17), was an online show<br/>
dedicated to the exploration of erotic themes as depicted in American and<br/>
Japanese electronic media through games, popular dress-up programs, and other<br/>
media.  In her words, SBH is a “hybrid with traditional curatorial models’ in<br/>
that it combines those accepted selection methods with the informal practice of<br/>
‘collecting links’, access to downloads and the submission of informal reviews<br/>
(18).  The exhibition is therefore reflective of both previously extant<br/>
museological practice translated to the Web, combined with the Do-It-Yourself<br/>
(DIY) aesthetic of the personal website.  The merging of conventional methods<br/>
with commonly used web authoring practices shows the influence of the personal<br/>
website as curatorial practice, as on the web, ‘everyone can be a curator’, to<br/>
paraphrase Schleiner.  While the author’s and Schleiner’s projects incorporate<br/>
experiments in time, compilation and collective curation, there is still a<br/>
centralized sense of curatorial vision within these projects and the resultant<br/>
fetishization of the body of data as objet d’art. However, the experiments in<br/>
modifying the traditional curatorial process have resulted in viable<br/>
exhibitions, and may be seen as having the potential for further<br/>
experimentation.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Internet has caused a proliferation of exhibition opportunities for artists<br/>
working in the electronic genres, and through the early vision of the Internet<br/>
as a collaborative workspace, the possibility that there would be varying<br/>
degrees of collaboration in technological art curation seems evident.  However,<br/>
the issues of any body of work’s legitimacy that are overlaid upon any online<br/>
show that does not use traditional curatorial models through the power<br/>
structures that are associated with traditionalist museological practice create<br/>
varying levels of opportunity for that legitimacy.  Much of the ascription of<br/>
acceptance on the larger culture in regards to online shows often relates to<br/>
the media savvy of the curator/organizer and the ability to address the mass<br/>
media aspects of the online world.  In addition, a certain amount audience<br/>
targeting in order to attempt at engaging with the potential audience through a<br/>
certain amount of thematic/topical focus is also important for a larger<br/>
acceptance for a body of works.  These aspects of online curatorial practice,<br/>
both traditional and experimental, are intertwined with any attempt at creating<br/>
any novel form of gallery practice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As experimentation continues, the difference between collaborative art,<br/>
database collection/visualization, communal activity, and more traditional<br/>
curatorial practices often becomes slim.  As various artists and practitioners<br/>
attempt to create focal points for the exposition of creative processes, these<br/>
genres will likely intertwine in inseparable, yet discernable ways, such as<br/>
Idealine’s method of database-driven curation.  There will also undoubtedly be<br/>
more independent offerings that incorpoate experimental methods, such as<br/>
Schleiner’s and my own work, as well as process-driven projects such as Merging<br/>
Identity and sito.  One of the key questions in regards to these future<br/>
aesthetic engagements will be the context in which they are seen by the larger<br/>
art world as to their legitimation and perceived mode of representation (work,<br/>
exhibition, database, etc).    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As institutions like the Whitney, Walker, Guggenheim, and so on continue their<br/>
investiture into the online and hybrid worlds, their increased participation<br/>
will reinscribe the agendas of traditionalist curatorial and museological<br/>
practices into genres such as net.art.  This will create certain challenges for<br/>
the non-traditional curator, but will also not prevent the further exploration<br/>
of atypical curatorial practices from taking place.  The development of<br/>
independent curatorial practice in light of the emergent digital communications<br/>
environment will undoubtedly create an experimental compliment that traditional<br/>
institutions are bound to adopt in part, if the emergence of various<br/>
independent curation models (such as collaborative ones discussed herein)<br/>
become more widespread.  The bottom line is that since larger institutions are<br/>
adopting new curatorial (though more traditionalist) models for the acquisition<br/>
of technological art, the relationship between artist and curator will be bound<br/>
to vary.  It will be interesting to observe what shape that variance will take,<br/>
and how it reflects the nature of the online society.<br/>

many of these shows) that related a comment that I asked about who ‘got to<br/>
pick’ the art in the exhibition.<br/>
