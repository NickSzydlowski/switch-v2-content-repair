Events in the North Bay SoundCulture '96 took place from April 2nd through April 13th in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, as the "third trans-pacific festival  of sonic art and contemporary sound practice." It is the third festival to bear the name SoundCulture, following one in Sydney in October 1991, and one in Tokyo in 1993. SoundCulture was initiated by a group of Australian artists and arts organizers. The next SoundCulture event is being planned for 1998 in New Zealand. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
A large undertaking, SoundCulture '96 was for budgetary reasons non-centrally funded. A group of seven "organizing institutions" worked on putting the festival together, while 25 more "participating institutions" devoted part of their resources to providing support in the form of performancespace, funding assistance, graphic design and printing, etc. As such, there was less consistency in terms of design and implementation of the various shows, publicity pieces and the like. In the place of consistency, however, was a wonderfully diverse variety of viewpoints, aesthetic styles and artistic methods. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
All in all, kudos should be given to Ed Osborn, the director, and the rest of the organizers, for putting together such a wonderfully diverse program, utilizing a diverse set of resources. Perhaps the organization of SC96 provides a decentralized cooperative model for the funding of large cultural events in this age of diminishing funding options. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The festival was quite large. Altogether, I count 64 events (including performances, panel sessions, radio broadcasts and receptions for gallery shows), and 17 installations and gallery works on the program. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend much of the festival due to prior commitments, but I wouldlike to describe two pieces which took place on Saturday, April 6th in Marin County as part of a series of events that day entitled Audible Terrain: A Day of SoundCulture Events in the North Bay. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Ann Wettrich's Aviary Commute took place aboard the 10:50 Golden Gate Transit Bus #80 from San Francisco to San Raphael. The composition invites participants to "turn an ordinary bus ride into an ornithological migration." Participants were asked to meet at the bus station and to bring a portabletape player. Kathy Kennedy's soundwalk/performance piece entitled "The Blue Pathway," a rather successful attempt at creating a deep listening environment in a public place, took place on Saturday April 6th at the Corte Madera Town Center Mall, about 30 minutes north of San Francisco. <br/><br/>

As I'm staying near the bus line, I've decided to meet the bus part way into its route. The bus arrives, and I want to make sure its the right one. Before I get on, I ask the driver, "Are there a bunch of birds on this bus?" <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
"I don't know what you're talking about," he says. <br/><br/>
"Is this the bus for the SoundCulture event?" <br/><br/>
"I don't know anything about anything like that." <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
I notice a man several seats behind the driver waving at me, motioning for me to be quiet and not give away the secret. This is interesting, because I am not aware that there is a secret. I get on and move toward the back, where I find a seat near some people I recognize from other SoundCulture events. (I must be in the right place...) <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
A few minutes later as we make our way through the city toward the Golden Gate Bridge, tape players begin to appear from various hidden locations - inside a toolbox, a pocket, a picnic basket, a backpack. Birds start to make appearances. A loon is calling up near the front. A meadowlark, a magpie. A flock of geese appear to my right, sparrows across the aisle, blue night herons to my left! By the time we start across the bridge, a veritable cacophony of aviary vocalizations fills the bus.
<br/><br/>
Responses to the sound amongst the bus riders are mixed. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
"I love birds! I have a parrot, and I had a Macaw growing up!" <br/><br/>
"That's insufferable, that noise. You'll have to turn it off!" <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The driver seems to be amongst the dissenting bunch. His amplified voice descends over the bus like a dioxin-based defoliant. "All Right! Please keep it down now...(pause) I'll ask one more time, please keep the noise down." When the noise does not cease, he comes back over the PA, "I'll tell you one more time: It's very easy for me to pull over and start handing out transfers! (pause) I get paid by the hour." Presumably, he is telling us this to make us aware that he'll gladly spend the time to remove us all individually from the bus. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
After some discussion, we decide that everyone will stay on the bus, leaving their tape players turned off until we're within one stop of our destination. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
We pull into the San Raphael station, aviary cacophony back in full-swing. Departing the bus, a couple of women discuss how they like the sounds, and one man comments, "Those people should be shot, along with the birds!" <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The migration continues up main street, stopping in a thrift store along the way. The three women working in the thrift store seem delighted to have this large group of bird-sound toting people coming in. They tell bird stories. One woman used to live in a house with birds in the attic. "I hate them! They used to fly in my hair!" We asked her, "What kind of birds were they?" "I don't know - flying birds!" <br/><br/>

On a busy Saturday afternoon in a fairly ordinary Californian outdoor shopping mall, a small low-power radio transmitter sits in a tree near the center. About 15 performers tune their portable radios to the frequency of the transmitter, and position themselves somewhat sparsely around the walkways. Each performer also has an instrument (a woman to my left sings; Oliver Di Cicco, the instrument designer, plays his "neo-bullroarer;" a woman sits behind me loudly chewing carrots and spitting watermelon seeds; another across from me plays a flute.) As a tape plays through the transmitter, the performers react to one another, to the broadcast sound coming from their radios, to the environment as a whole. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Unsuspecting shoppers wonder what is going on: they stop to read signs which explain that this is a soundwalk composition, meant to awaken new perspectives of listening. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
These elements create a light sonic web - a subtly new acoustic matrix which draws our ears. A voice speaks to us from the radios: <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Listen, listen - Listen! what do you hear around you? Footsteps. The hushed mumbling of the other walkers... The wind in the trees. On your face. Crackling of pebbles and branches under your feet. The distant roar of industry, technology, progress. Listen, listen - Listen! The sound of your breath as you walk. You can even hear your own clothes make noise; cotton, leather, and nylon rubbing against each other as you move. Listen, listen - Listen. Cage is known to have said that when he entered the sound vacuum he could still hear the sound of his own nervous system, and of the blood flowing through his veins. Are you trying? Can you hear that? Keep on - and don't even bother to look in front of you. You don't really need to find where you want to go. Let your instincts steer you through the trees, from a dark place to a light one, from a cluttered, enclosed space to a clearing.
Keep on. That's what we have to do most naturally, on all levels. Find for ourselves a path that leads to clarity. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
AHA! <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
- a slight transformation of space. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
This is not an everyday shopping experience... <br/><br/>
The new sounds cause the atmosphere to shift just slightly, and people who are listening are reminded and made freshly aware of often ignored senses. Shoppers seem to smile and pause to listen and watch; children ask what we are doing. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
This shift of atmosphere is subtle but profound as the shoppers' individual North-American-personal-boundary-spheres open slightly in response to this inviting new matrix of sound and performers. The slightly opened spheres let in more light, smells, sounds... <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
a smile, ..... here ..... and ..... there - <br/><br/>
