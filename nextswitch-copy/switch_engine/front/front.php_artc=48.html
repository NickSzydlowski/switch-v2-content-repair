</p>           Interview with <a href="front.php_artc%3d48.html#bio">Vangie "Aurora" Beal</a>             - Director of GameGirlz.Com - http://www.gamegirlz.com<br/>	             by Geri Wittig and Max Hardcore:	<p> <img height="80" src="../../../web/v5n2/images/gglogo.gif" width="100"/> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Geri Wittig:</b> On the surface it doesn't appear that             the GameGirlz site has any overt feminist stance (no links to feminist             sites, etc.) and there's definitely not a separatist ideology, but in             looking at your site, I would say that the GameGirlz are a phenomenon             that is expanding the feminist front through their engagement with             technology and through a forum that displays that engagement on many             levels - what do you see as the GameGirlz place in or relationship to             feminist discourse and movements? </p> <p> <b>Vangie Beal:</b> This is certainly a topic I've spent a             lot of time discussing with our Lead Editor, Damon. In all honesty, the             common connotation of feminism isn't really what GameGirlz is about...             or should I say the connotation that is accepted by chauvinistic males.             I think Mur, our weekly GameGirlz columnist, said it best when she said             that her view of it is equality. Not pro-women, or pro-men; just             equality. That may look like pro-women right now, but only because at             this point they are currently not treated as equals. But equality is             really the underlying goal. </p> <p> <b>GW:</b> What was your purpose in starting the GameGirlz             site and does your intentionality change as the site evolves? What have             you discovered along the way? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> When I started the GameGirlz site almost two             years ago, my only goal was to create a website where girls who were             into games didn't have to wade through the semi-nude pictures and             scroll through the jokes only a guy could appreciate. I felt there were             quite a few game sites online with great content already, but overall             the whole social aspect of online gaming felt like this big "boys             only club". I wanted to make a site where both male and female             gamers could get up-to-date information on Internet gaming, and where             women wouldn't feel offended at the site. We still do this, but of             course our site has changed a lot and has expanded greatly. Despite the             growth, our original goal is still the main focus. </p> <p>            Along the way I have discovered many things. For instance, there are a             lot more females playing games online than I ever imagined. I've also             discovered that there are many developers out there who are interested             in trying to capture that elusive female gamer market. Surprisingly,             there are also women who work in the games industry who don't want it             publicly known that they are female, out of fear as to how they would             be perceived by those working outside their company, in the same field. </p> <p> <b>Max Hardcore:</b> Do you, as a female player, ever feel             like a drag king? For example, when you play Quake, wield your weapons             and enter the primarily male discourse domain of networked shooters, is             it akin to putting on a strap-on dildo? Or is it an entirely feminine             experience? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> That would depend on your definition of feminine             :). When I play I don't really think in terms of man/woman, but when I             go out and play with the ladies in my clan, I find it is a more             "womanly" experience, but it is the social aspect that brings             those feelings, not the game and game play itself. </p> <p> <b>MH:</b> Is fragging better than sex? Is there any             correlation between the two? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> Well to be honest, I've played a few Quake games             that were intense enough to be *almost* orgasmic. Is fragging better             than sex? Well, I would say no it isn't, but I've heard "Honey             turn that damn game off and come to bed!", often enough to really             make me wonder about that. </p> <p>            Sex and fragging are a lot alike. It really all comes down to; how well             you can strafe, your re-fire rate, how long you can last in the game,             and how big of a weapon you get. </p> <p> <b>GW:</b> What is the GameGirlz economic model? For             instance, how do you fund the site and how do you decide what to             include in terms of advertising? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> The website is not funded. Every day since we             have started GameGirlz, the contributors work on different features,             interviews, and do daily news because they love gaming and the idea             behind a female-oriented website. No one on our staff is paid             (including me), and the banner ads we run are for our network hosts,             GameStats. GameStats provides us with unlimited disk space, and             immediate tech support for our website in exchange for hosting             GameGirlz. Depending on how many ad views our site does, there is an             opportunity to receive a percentage of ad revenue from GameStats. </p> <p>            Because we aren't a paid website, the staff has free reign over what             they do, and when they do it. No one has to log in at a certain time             and update, and we don't set deadlines. The site still continues to             provide news, reviews and such on a daily basis though, simply because             it is the staff's forum, and we all really enjoy doing this. If one of             the staff members can't log in, we don't question it; we just find             something else to do! </p> <p> <b>GW:</b> It seems that at the crux of many of the issues             that female gamers face is the divide between the developer and the             user - what kind of impact do you think the GameGirlz site is having on             that situation? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> GameGirlz gets quite a bit of response from             developers in the computer games industry. At times we've placed polls             and surveys on our site, asking females what they would like to see in             this game, or what attributes the female character should have etc for             developers. In the majority of game companies, you'll find a dozen or             two males who are developing a game they all love, and since they are             males, they just don't know what elements in the game could be added or             changed to be more attractive to a female gamer. </p> <p>            I think it is absolutely wonderful to have developers ask, because when             I shell out my 50+ dollars for a game, I know that at some point the             company thought about me as a consumer when developing their game. </p> <p> <b>GW:</b> What would you like to see emerge in the area of             game development - your ideal game? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> My ideal game does exist, somewhat. Its called             Half-Life. Well, actually, Half-Life with an option to play a kick-ass             female character would be the ideal. As far as game development goes,             it is heading in the direction of games which focus on multiplayer and             interactivity through both text and real time voice chat. This is both             exciting and, something I think is going to make for some wonderful             games. </p> <p> <b>GW:</b> In spending some time with the site, it's quite             easy to come to know or observe on some level the GameGirlz social             dynamics. For instance, in reading your coverage of the E3 show in Los             Angeles, it became apparent that the GameGirlz crew operates to a large             extent telepresently (you hadn't seen HaB and Mur for a year and it was             the first time you'd met Goliath and Cassandra). From reading             editorials and interviews, I learned "family" details, such             as Jason "loony boi" Bergman is Bobbi's brother and that you             have a son. This type of personal information makes the GameGirlz seem             very accessible, which I think would be beneficial to building             community, but it also seems like it could have some negative             repercussions how do you deal with or relate to your telepresent             visibility? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> When we first started we didn't include this             kind of information on our site. Awhile back I wrote an article for a             game magazine that discussed being a game girl, and my advice on what             information you should not give out about yourself for protection.             After a year of running GameGirlz, I swear I've broken most of my own             rules about that. In light of saying that, however, I still would never             provide the kind of direct information that would enable anyone to             contact me in any way other than an e-mail message. </p> <p>            In my case, from GameGirlz.com, you can find a link to my personal             website, which contains a lot of information about me. You can see             photos, you can find out what my favorite dessert is. I think this             shows I'm just an average girl who loves games, and that I don't do GG,             Clan PMS, Female tourneys and the likes for any reason other than I             have fun doing it. </p> <p>            I think if I write an editorial, someone can come read it and say             "Cool!" and, well that's it. If I say somewhere that I'm a             single mother, than any single mothers who play the kinds of games I do             now feel like they know me. Chances are if the person who reads what             you have to say can identify with some aspect of you as a person or             some aspect of your life; they're more apt to come back. Chances are             they'll even pop off a nice e-mail telling me about their kids and how             great it is to have found someone who loves the things they love. </p> <p>            I don't think this social aspect would happen if I remain just a name             tagged onto the end of a game review. I'd much rather be a person to             the people who visit GameGirlz, rather than just some             "author". </p> <p> <b>MH:</b> Do you converse with your enemies when you are             in a frag fest? What sorts of things do you say to one another? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> It depends on the game. When I'm out fragging             with the girls in the clan, we laugh a lot and taunt each other back             and forth. Sometimes on random servers we'll find out where others are             from and that sort of thing. On servers where there's rude and             obnoxious people playing, the comments get nasty (from the Quake girlz             as well as the guys) like, "I may not have a dick but you're still             going to be riding my rocket". All in all, Quake is not a nice             game, and you can't expect everyone to say nice things when they play.             When I log in as PMS-Aurora, I think it's fairly obvious I'm a chick,             and when the comments turn to outright insulting and unbearable             comments, I just find another server to play on. </p> <p>            I usually tend to ignore the "chatting" most of the time             anyway. That's what IRC is for. Quake servers are for fragging. </p> <p> <b>MH:</b> What are the steps I would need to go through to             become one of your towel boys? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> Well, first we fly you to a sunny beach, where             we test out your ability to hand feed grapes and fetch us ladies             drinks. During this time you're also tested to see if you are able to             love, honor, worship and obey. You also have to prove to us that you             can wash your own clothes and do your own damn dishes! Oh wait, those             are the fantasy towel boys... oops! My apologies. </p> <p>            Actually, to be a towel boy, you have to be a good person, be someone             who can take a joke, deal with the varying moods and personalities of             20+ women, have fun, and be able to deal with getting your butt kicked             by us girlz. :) The Towel Boys are our online male friends, who wanted             to be a part of Clan PMS, but didn't meet the "must be             female" requirement. </p> <p> <b>GW:</b> What's the next big challenge or goal for             GameGirlz? </p> <p> <b>VB:</b> The next big challenge for us is to work on             making interaction with other players through GameGirlz more             accessible, and enable female gamers to get in contact with other             female gamers. </p> <p> </p> <hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="600"/> <p> <a name="bio">Vangie "Aurora" Beal</a>, is a 23             year-old mother and webmaster, located in Nova Scotia, Canada. She is a             hard-core computer gamer, and is actively involved in the online gaming             community.
