      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> EMAC was 

        first offered as a BS degree in 1996. It is a program jointly managed 

        by the Arts Department and the Department of Language, Literature, and 

        Communication. It began first as a "track" for interested communication 

        majors (undergrads) who also wanted to take electronic arts classes. After 

        it was recognized as a degree, the program was flooded with an unexpected 

        40 students for the first freshman class. The institute administration 

        was doubtful that it would attract any students. Since that time, EMAC 

        has attracted over 50 freshman students each Fall, many additional students 

        commit to the program after they enroll at RPI in other majors - those 

        who don't learn about the program until they are already Freshman, during 

        Orientation. More and more, students are coming to RPI specifically for 

        this degree program, and many say they had no alternative school. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The Arts 

        Department at RPI has offered a graduate degree, MFA in Electronic Arts 

        since 1991. Undergraduate classes in arts and music are offered as a "service" 

        to the large Engineering, Science, and Social Science student population, 

        as part of the Institute's core requirement of 24 credits in the school 

        of Humanities and Social Sciences. </font>

        offered an undergraduate degree in Communication, as well as Masters

        years. RPI was the first school to offer a Graduate Degree in Technical

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?

        </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Although 

        the requirements show that students take 4 credits (minimum) in history/theory 

        courses, from the selection of courses like: "The Multi-Media Century" 

        - a grounding in the art historical stages of modernism, "Television and 

        Culture" - a course that analyses TV and alternatives to the dominant 

        information source..they also take courses in other disciplines. This 

        is not a 100% art course, so their requirements are divided with Communications 

        Theory. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Truly, 

        the RPI student interest is on learning the latest technology and having 

        hands-on access to studio gear. Our pedagogical approach, however, is 

        that they must also be equipped with the theoretical background to support 

        their technical ability, and the analytical skills to offer them longevity 

        in the workplace, so that they are not easily replaced with new software 

        specialists. The EMAC program also equips students to write, communicate, 

        and present their ideas in a critical environment.</font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The EMAC 

        program has a built-in duality, that combines the artistic training and 

        rigor from the Arts Department, and communication skills and design focus 

        from the LL&amp;C Department. In addition, many of the EMAC majors choose 

        to be a dual major. Of the offerings at RPI, the most selected majors 

        are Computer Science and Management, with a smattering of various Engineering 

        disciplines. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Beginning 

        Fall 2000, the EMAC curriculum will become more rigorous. This is a result 

        of the programs growth, and from observing student needs. Since the beginning 

        of the program, many courses have been added, due to the addition of faculty 

        and the needs of the growing student population. The Arts Department faculty 

        -- for example-- has doubled, since EMAC began. To bring the curriculum 

        requirements up to par with the actual program being taken by students 

        (and offered by the Institute), a concentration will be required of each 

        EMAC student, a combination of courses that will be selected with academic 

        advising -- that can cross disciplines. For example, students who focus 

        on Animation will build a concentration from a mix of drawing, film 

        theory, and animation classes. They can also elect to concentrate in Community 

        Service, and take courses in the Science Technology Studies program, Arts 

        and LL&amp;C, as well as courses in Human Computer Interaction, (HCI) combining 

        science, psychology and arts. The Concentration is designed to feed into 

        the Capstone course, which is a two semester senior level sequence that 

        requires a research component, thesis and final project that is exhibited 

        publicly.</font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 

        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Our students 

        are regularly presented with public programs on campus, as part of the 

        Electronic Arts Performing Series, where top level artists, musicians, 

        and theoreticians are invited to lecture, present, or otherwise interact 

        with students. This differs from the campus lecture series, in that students 

        also assist with the setup and breakdown of events, and have a personal 

        Q&amp;A with the visitor the morning after. Every semester, an artist in residence 

        is on campus several times, and the residency results in a final presentation 

        (in which students participate in the project). </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> There are 

        also campus wide lectures and programs that bring historians, theoreticians,

        to students. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Arts and 

        LL&amp;C faculty regularly take students to New York City or to other cultural

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">RPI is primarily 

        a school KNOWN for educating Engineers and Computer Scientists. However, 

        our Career Development Center has made a point to target companies who 

        would seek out the employment (or coops and or internships) of students 

        who have artistic and creative writing skills. There has been a great 

        response to this development and an increase in the number of graduates 

        who qualify for interviews. The Spring 2000 class numbered 32 students.</font>

        of your program? </b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Students 

        master a variety of integrated electronic arts skills. They must be facile

        graphic design, and writing. In addition, animation, hypertext, sculpture, 

        3D, and radio/television production are often popular courses that students 

        seek mastery in. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Each course 

        is accompanied by a fair amount of reading assignments, written coursework, 

        and discussion/critique. RPI is not a theory heavy course of study, it 

        is designed in the spirit and energy of the Engineering and Computer Science 

        Schools: hands-on, can-do. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The LL&amp;C

      <p>EMAC is one of the first, if not the first, program of its kind which 

        not only combines computer technology and an arts/graphic design aspect,
