      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The Digital 

        Media program is within the Department of Studio Art, which is one of 

        four departments within the School of the Arts. The other departments 

        are Dance, Drama, and Music. In general, the Department of Studio Art 

        takes a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary view of contemporary art practice. 

        The Department emphasizes a demanding, conceptual approach to work in 

        process in addition to traditional notions of product. Students are encouraged 

        to develop an individual, disciplined direction through an experimental 

        approach to media, materials, and techniques. Faculty representing an 

        area (there are two of us in the digital arts area), develop curricula 

        and research agendas. One faculty member leads the area (myself). </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Irvine 

        is known for being strong in the Arts, Sciences, and Engineering. As one 

        of the youngest campuses in the 9 campus UC system, it is one of the fastest 

        growing. Over the next decade, there will be more growth at UCI than any 

        other UC campus. Digital Arts are being embraced quite actively in terms 

        of new hires within the School of the Arts (SOTA), and elsewhere on campus. 

        Currently a search for a new hire to be jointly appointed between SOTA 

        and ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) was just concluded. More 

        such searches are planned, partly to help initiate new interdisciplinary 

        arts and sciences programs. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Resources 

        supporting the digital arts at UCI are rapidly expanding as well. Construction 

        was just completed on a Music &amp; Media building housing motion capture 

        facilities, electronic music labs, and a high-end research and development 

        computer lab. Construction is under way on the Beall Center for Art and 

        Technology, slated to open Fall 2000 with an opening exhibition on computer 

        games and art. Construction is beginning this summer on a new Studio Art 

        building which will have several new media labs. </font>

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?

        </b></font> 

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We emphasize 

        both theory and practice. We avoid an application based focus. Instead 

        we stress ideas, and let the technology needed to help realize the ideas 

        follow the concept. We tend toward conceptual and experimental practices, 

        and encourage collaborative work. We stress students take an interdisciplinary 

        approach to their creative practice, and encourage courses in the information 

        and computer sciences, as well as the social sciences and humanities.

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which are 

        most influential depends upon the project/course. For example, the proposed 

        Interdisciplinary Gaming Studies Program (IGaSP) will facilitate fundamental 

        research and development in areas germane to games and gaming from within 

        an interdisciplinary framework. Topics for investigation include: networked 

        multimedia delivery; information discovery; visualization; distributed 

        processing; software agent design; human computer interaction; low-bandwidth 

        and high-bandwidth immersive environments, gender and the politics of 

        representation, and content development and evaluation. IGaSP projects 

        will have direct impact on pedagogy, and help educate students to work 

        as critically informed producers and consumers in a transnational entertainment 

        economy operating at the nexus of art, science, and technology. Currently 

        IGaSP is comprised of faculty from departments within Information and 

        Computer Science, the School of the Arts, the School of Social Sciences, 

        and the School of Engineering, and will expand from there. IGaSP can play 

        an important role in helping to provide students with concrete job skills 

        that will allow them to work with a high degree of sophistication in artistic 

        and technical capacities in the rapidly growing multimedia industry. Particularly 

        for those talented graduates and undergraduates who collaborate on core 

        R&amp;D, IGaSP will help give a firm foundation in computer programming and 

        software engineering, communication theory, and creative collaboration 

        in relation to interactive gaming environments. The intention is for IGaSP 

        to help provide bridges to those talented students possessing in-depth 

        familiarity with current technologies, and have enough insight to translate 

        these skills to technologies on the horizon. Such training will produce 

        people capable of thinking in a more comprehensive way about the planning, 

        design, creation, and content of computer games by exposing the most talented 

        to an array of research initiatives linked across a diverse set of interests 

        and disciplines.</font>
