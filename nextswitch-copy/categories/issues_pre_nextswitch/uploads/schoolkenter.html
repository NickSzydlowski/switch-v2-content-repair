        Design department was started in 1996. At that time I was working in New 

        York City at the American Museum of Natural History, doing freelance work 

        designing games and other new media software, and working as a part time 

        faculty member at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. I 

        came to QUT here in Brisbane, Australia to hang the detail on the newly 

        established BA program in Communication Design. Communication Design sits 

        within The Academy of Arts next to the Music, Dance, Acting and Visual 

        Arts programs. Our Arts Faculty are about to be reorganized around a $20M++ 

        new facility that will also place us next to Film and TV, Journalism, 

        Creative Writing and possibly a range of other Communication Arts disciplines.</font>

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
      
        Since 1996 we have firmly grounded that degree in studio training for 

        new media artists and designers. We view students as self-directed creative 

        individuals that require direction by our staff to develop and refine 

        creative, artistic and professional skills.</font>

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
      
        We have established facilities for drawing and those fundamental artistic 

        and visualization skills, labs and studios for all forms of new media 

        design and for digital video and audio, and 3-D animation. We maintain 

        a huge array of servers for basic web stuff right through to advanced 

        web applications development, including rich media and streaming.</font>

        a 3 year Bachelor of Arts and additional Honours degree which makes up

        of Arts Students undertake core studies from the Faculty of Arts as well 

        as practical studies in Interactive Design, Animation and Electronic Publishing. 

        Industry secondments and professional studies form part of the course. 

        The course prepares graduates for entry into a variety of existing and 

        emerging creative industries through emphasizing the development of creative 

        and design skills in an information technology context. The student community 

        is a diverse group where collaboration and the development of individual 

        specializations is encouraged. Students graduate with a fully developed 

        portfolio of new media works. </font>

        allows students to choose from three separate "strands." They are Interactive 

        Design, Computer Animation, and Games and Entertainment Technologies.

        of Communication Design is an accelerated course, an advanced version 

        of the current Communication Design offerings. The degree aims to help 

        professionals in established industries gain a significant grounding in 

        design, new media and communications technologies. This new course will 

        meet the rapidly expanding field in the electronic media industry as well as 

        other applications. Most industries are using or beginning to use new 

        electronic media and this course will cater to professionals requiring 

        training to meet the needs of "industry" in general. This broad focus 

        allows opportunity for application and entry into a number of fields and 

        will help the evolution of electronic media applications as the demand 

        for new technology increases. We are currently refining the M Com Design 

        more clearly towards industry development focusing on operational and 

        management issues and using project teams drawn from BA and BA Hons students.</font>
