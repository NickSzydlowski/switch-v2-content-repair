      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">New media 

        art forms are rapidly maturing into an integral part of the landscape 

        of contemporary arts research in academia. The emergence of these technology 

        based art forms are radically challenging many of our most basic notions 

        about art and culture -- what it means as practicing artists to be cultural 

        producers, what constitutes a cultural object or aesthetic experience, 

        and what skill sets and conceptual strategies are required for the artist, 

        critic and audience to understand and integrate the importance of this 

        new work in the future. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> As these 

        new arts categories continue to evolve and traditional disciplines become 

        redefined in light of these changes, in 1998 the Department of Art Practice 

        at UC Berkeley targeted their first hire full-time in a decade specifically 

        to establishing a major new research effort in this area, and to facilitate 

        the development and swift introduction of long overdue digital arts research 

        into the departmental and campus community and curriculum. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Like most 

        start-up areas, an extraordinary amount of time, energy and focus has 

        been spent on building the research infrastructure and working relationships 

        critical to achieving and sustaining a world class program in digital 

        media at Berkeley. With little precedent on campus for this emerging arts 

        area, we started from scratch with the design and construction of the 

        laboratories and networks, organizing new computing and technology equipment 

        purchases, and facilitating the building of cross-disciplinary campus connections 

        central to research in this discipline. This foundational work was done 

        quickly and carefully, and within the programs first two years. Each aspect 

        of this new initiative has been done in a way that allowed campus and 

        systemwide feedback in the process, and it is being continually refined 

        and managed as we moved the department toward our strategic goals in this 

        area. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The program 

        beginning to be designed at UC Berkeley is a broad based interdisciplinary 

        research environment dedicated to the pioneering of alternative tools, 

        methods and thought processes involved in the creation of new and experimental 

        technology art genres. It is designed to present students with both a 

        critical review of emerging media technologies (understanding of how new 

        media technology impacts art, society and culture), and to encourage the 

        development of practical skills that embody those ideas through personal 

        expression, creative experimentation, and imaginative risk taking (the 

        practice of creating art where technology can be used in more poetic, 

        humane and creative ways). Questioning the nature of art, personalizing 

        the impact of technology, and inventing news forms of art propositions 

        is the central focus of the course work. </font>

        courses and curricular topics under development for 2000 - 2001 include 

        Digital Film/Video, Telematic Studio, Modeling and Animation, Media and 

        Web Design, Human Machine Interface and Spatial Imaging. These time-based 

        digital media courses are project-driven and active learning environments 

        that emphasize interdisciplinary and collaborative arts research approaches. 

        They help demonstrate the artistic possibilities of technology by studying 

        the pioneering work of artists around the world who work with concepts, 

        tools, and information contexts not usually defined as art, and also encourage 

        students to reconsider the interrelationships of science, technology, 

        media, and culture, and to integrate the skills of monitoring scientific 

        research and emerging technologies as they relate to potentially important 

        art production in the future. </font>

        evolving systems, designs for distributed communication and information

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The digital 

        arts faculty and curriculum on campus are essentially positioned as an 

        arena for meta-disciplinary practitioners who also theorize and critique 

        their own practice in relation to its technological, cultural, and social 

        implications. Emphasis is placed on creating a natural bridge across the 

        traditional disciplinary divide between the humanities and the sciences. 

        Through the drive to create new technologies, and re-purpose existing 

        ones to innovative artistic and intellectual ends, our digital artists 

        by definition adopt highly interdisciplinary models of research, often 

        spanning a range of research and development interests oriented toward 

        practical creative production. Through these broad hybridization digital 

        artists we are generating great enthusiasm within the university, the 

        corporate sector, and the public at large. Yet because of this we are 

        still frequently misunderstood and traditional academic analysis to site 

        this new work conceptually, culturally, and historically has been difficult. 

        Such interdisciplinary dialogue between creative production and programmatic 

        development is precisely how our research and teaching programs are being 

        created. </font>

        2000, the Digital Media Program co-sponored CRASH: the Berkeley Symposium 

        on Critical Issues in Net Art. Sponsored by grants from the Berkeley Consortium 

        for the Arts, the Department of Art Practice, the Berkeley Art Museum, 

        the College of Engineering, and the InterCampus Arts Association, the 

        symposium devoted its energies toward identifying critical, aesthetic, 

        and art historical issues raised by the emergence of a new form of art, 

        "net.art": art specific to the Internet. The Symposium was designed to 

        bring together an interdisciplinary group of art historians, theorists 

        and critics who had little prior exposure to net.art, and engage in an 

        open dialogue to discuss how and if this new genre of work can be 

        sited, conceptually, critically and historically. During the first evening 

        of the symposium, Steve Dietz, a curator at the Walker Art Center and 

        an authority on net art, presented a campus wide lecture on a cross section 

        of net art projects, and the participants in public and private sessions. 

        Net based artists visited the campus for the symposium and simultaneously 

        gave public lectures to the campus community, and workshops in other arts 

        and science disciplines. An edited transcription of the symposium dialogue 

        will be compiled and published both on the web and in print this Summer

        to sustaining and extending the dialogue of emerging technology research 

        our digital media students are encouraged to simultaneously question the 

        validity of traditional venues for exhibiting emerging work, as well as 

        engage with close working relationships with many Bay Area museums including 

        our own Berkeley Art Museum, and Pacific Film Archives. These engagements 

        include ongoing outside student research projects that pose these questions. 
        
        This past year we worked closely with Steven Seid, curator 

        of video at the PFA to speak to our classes and show new and historical 

        video work from the archive, as well as sponsor the very first premiere 

        of experimental student "digital videos" from the Department of Art Practice 

        at the Pacific Film Archives. A broad range of student work selected by 

        the PFA curators from our Art 160 Digital Video course was shown in December 

        at the new home of the Archive on Bancroft. The premiere screened 15 to 

        20 new student works plus offered a post show question and answer session 

        with student film makers responding to the public. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Concurrently 

        this past Fall we organized an opportunity for the digital media students 

        to assist resident French artist Valery Grancher, in constructing his 

        new "24Hr00" internet project commissioned by the Berkeley Art Museum. 

        24 Art Practice students were asked to take a photographic portrait every 

        hour, on the hour for one entire day. Each photo would be accompanied 

        by a single word that described their feelings at the moment. The images 

        were scanned and coded into a grid on the museum web site, where  

        visitors could then construct over 600,000 24 frame sequences of temporal possibilities 

        from these images. The web site allows viewers to choose the time, an 

        individual or their state of mind in the project to generate a kind of 

        short web-based filmic montage of a day in the life of these Berkeley 

        art students. Along with their attendance at his public lecture, Grancher 

        was also invited by the students to join us in class for a discussion 

        of his work and their intimate participation in the collaborative design 

        of his project. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This Spring 

        digital media students in the Department Art Practice at UC Berkeley and 

        museum studies students at Sonoma State University Art Department collaborated 

        on a project entitled CU, using the Internet and digital video to explore: 

        how personal and social meaning is conveyed through art objects, their 

        presentation in gallery installations, and their representation in electronic 

        media; and how art can be a locus for interaction - multiple exchanges 

        of meaning between many different agents from gallery visitor to museum 

        cataloger. Students began by interacting anonymously via the Internet 

        (a typical mode of interaction on this medium), using assumed identities 

        to explore the roles of multiple different agents (artist, gallery visitor, 

        critic/historian). Berkeley students created art works based on the notion 

        of collections and installed them in the Worth Ryder Gallery. They reinterpreted  

        the art using web-cams to create digital videos. Sonoma students viewed 

        the digital videos online to uncover traces of meaning about the work 

        and the artist. They responded via the website by writing a poetic personal 

        response to the work, creating a museum catalog record for the work, and 

        then creating a profile of the artist, all based only on the evidence 

        of the online video. After these series of interactions, the students 

        met in the gallery for the first time to see how viewing the works through 

        the "lenses" of different art agents and different technologies extended, 

        informed, or changed their interaction with the art and with each other.

        collaboration with Berkeley's newly formed Consortium for the Arts and 

        Cal Performances, the digital media area helped organize graduate arts 

        faculty and their students from around the UC system to come to Berkeley 

        and engage in a hands-on performance-demonstration of Merce Cunningham's 

        groundbreaking digital dance notation project "Biped". Funding from Autodesk 

        and the ICA supported both the production and travel funds to bring representatives 

        from other UC campuses to the Berkeley performance, as well as the research 

        events planned around Cunningham's visit during the weekend of April 23-25, 

        1999. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Cunningham's 

        company performed twice at Berkeley, and offered open rehearsals on Saturday 

        afternoon to arts students and faculty. The accompanying demonstration 

        event was on Sunday. The event was important, because Autodesk's Kinetix 

        Character Studio Software allowed the creation of a new notation technique 

        and dance construction in virtual space. It also presented the broad range 

        of research possibilities integrating live performance and virtual environments 

        that has a unique potential in the digital arts. Discussion at the demonstration 

        consisted of dialogue on what this innovation involves for dance, on the 

        relations between technology, agency and the body as instrument in traditional 

        performing arts, and on the models of aesthetic judgment that we bring 

        to such work. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Concurrent 

        with the projected increase in campus enrollment over the next decade, 

        the art department has already noticed an extraordinary jump in the numbers 

        of students wanting to enroll in our courses, and most importantly the 

        request for majors (these are up 100% this last semester). The Department 

        attributes this both to the beginning of revitalization of the department 

        with a new hire, and an increased awareness by the student body and culture 

        at large that the unique intellectual discovery and metadisciplinary approaches 

        provided in the visual arts translates into an important strategy in the 

        culture of innovation. It is this perception that the arts are where 

        highly original research is nurtured and developed, and students understand 

        that this is specifically where they can begin to stake out new cultural 

        territory in an increasingly visual culture. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The revitalized 

        art department model we are developing is a realistically sized, intensely 

        interdisciplinary department with faculty expertise in many areas in and 

        outside the arts. The new model will be intricately woven into the research 

        fabric of the total university enterprise, including complex research 

        alliances throughout the campus. Because of our current size and the growing 

        demand for integrated digital arts education, an across the board increase 

        of full-time fte's and staff is being sought. This increase will help 

        us shore up the standing commitments we currently have, and help us quickly 

        develop important research alliances with other arts and sciences units 

        on campus and throughout the system. Along with these potential new hires, 

        we are committed to developing joint faculty programs with other collaborating 

        units including; engineering, dance, drama, music, architecture, rhetoric, 

        etc. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
