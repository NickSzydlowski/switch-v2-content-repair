      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The art 

        program here is quite old, Carnegie Mellon University just celebrated 

        its 100th anniversary and the Art school has been a part of it since the 

        beginning. The School of art has three studio areas. One is Painting/Drawing/Printmaking 
        
        (PDP) another is Sculpture/Installation/Site Specific (SIS) and 

        third is Electronic/Time Based work (ETB). We also have core curriculum 

        classes in an area called Concept. These classes are not media specific. 

        The New media classes are certainly in ETB which offer classes in Computer 

        Animation, Video, Sound Art, Robotic Art, Interactivity and Installation. 

        But there are many people using new media in Concept classes and in SIS 

        as well. There are also a lot of ways that media art slips into other 

        courses as a result of the hybrid nature of many of the university classes.</font>

        do you offer? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We offer 

        traditional BFA and MFA studio degrees. We also offer hybrid degrees, 

        the BHA (Bachelor of Humanities and Art) combines studio arts with humanities 

        like history or English or anthropology the student chooses their emphasis 

        in the humanities and in studio after selected core classes in each field. 

        The BSA (Bachelor of Science and Art) combines studio with science, popular 

        combinations with studio art in this degree might be computer science 

        or robotics or biology. </font>

        </font></b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Computers 

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction? 

        </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> You hit 

        the nail on the head with this question. It is the constant question of 

        how do you teach people to work with technology without just teaching 

        them to be technicians. We struggle with this because we certainly want 

        our students to have technical strengths, but we also realize that it is 

        useless to just teach ever changing software packages. Our goal is to 

        teach the extended history of new media along with the ability to learn 

        software and guide students to develop aesthetic ideas and make choices. 

        We have required freshman and sophomore classes in our core program called 

        Electronic Media Studios. These introduce technology and concepts of media 

        to students immediately and make them comfortable working with computers 

        if they have any fear. It also shows them how to work within the university 

        computing clusters so they are comfortable in Concept and other classes 

        developing projects that use technology. There is also a class that is 

        required by all freshman entering the university that is taken the week 

        before classes begin. It introduces students to primary aspects of computing.</font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There are 

        many approaches to new media here. In the School of Art, fine art and 

        activist art/community art are clear approaches, but Film/cinema and television 

        as well as animation, robotics, biology and semiology are all represented 

        in the mix of activity here. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The BHA 

        and BSA degrees I mentioned above are how we formally interact with other 

        programs in the institution, but there is an on going interest in interdisciplinary 

        work and studies. The school of art has a research center called The STUDIO 

        for Creative Inquiry <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/studio" target="_blank">http://www.cmu.edu/studio/</a> 

        which has fellows from around the world in many interdisciplinary fields 

        who develop and produce projects that have a relationship to art and usually 

        new media. The projects partner with community and academic groups to 

        help foster hybrids between the programs and the rest of the world.</font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 

        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We have 

        a lot of partners in education. There are many museums here. The Carnegie 

        Museum is right next door; the Warhol and Mattress Factory are in town 

        to name a few of the art institutions. We also work with the Carnegie 

        Science Center and institutions that aren't strictly art related. Frequently 

        students intern at these places, but they are also used regularly as part 

        of the coursework. We also have a visiting lecture series and frequently 

        we will invite artists or curators who are exhibiting at an institution 

        in town to present. We also co-sponsor as many as twenty lectures a year 

        with other institutions. </font>

        Do you receive industry support or maintain relationships with companies 

        who are interested in your graduates? </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Yes, there 

        are job fares on campus and the College of Fine Arts has an office for 

        placement and recruiting for art students. Carnegie Mellon University 

        in general gets tremendous industry support and the School of Art benefits 

        from that as well.</font>

        Can you describe the type of studio work that your digital media students 

        are primarily engaged in, and is theory and writing an important component of your program? </b></font>

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As I said 

        the studio work is tremendously varied. There are formal classes in video, 

        sound, animation, interactivity, performance and robotic art in the Electronic 

        Time Based Area of the School of Art. However, the School has a core program 

        of concept studios that are required each semester and a senior project 

        requirement. These classes are not media specific and tend to be where 

        a lot of the cross-disciplinary work is initiated. Sometimes there is 

        also cross-fertilization between the concept or project classes and the 

        media specific classes. There is a required theory component as well. 

        The best place to start looking is the school web site <a href="http://www-art.cfa.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">http://www-art.cfa.cmu.edu</a>, 

        it is a launching point to all the material about courses as well as projects 

        by students and faculty. An interesting recent collaborative student project 

        is: <a href="http://www.appliedautonomy.com/" target="_blank">http://www.appliedautonomy.com/</a></font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q8"></a>Q8</font></b></font> 

        Is there anything that is important for prospective students to understand about your program 

        that may assist them in choosing a place of study? </b> </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This program 

        is a hybrid between a traditional fine art program and an electronic/digital 

        media program. While some of the students who are accepted have a traditional 

        painting and drawing background we encourage people who have an alternative 

        view of art to apply as well, so that there is an interesting mix of ideas 

        and people. If you are doing work with a camcorder, Polaroid, performance, 

        computer animation/imaging or tinkering with electronics we want to see 

        it in your portfolio. We try to make this program about creativity and 

        ideas while teaching skills which cross multiple disciplines. If you don't 

        have a traditional art background, but you are involved and interested 

        in making original work in alternative media that is an excellent source 

        of material for a portfolio.</font><font color="#660099" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
