      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The Digital 

        Art Program is part of the studio art major, much like painting or printmaking 

        is. Students take foundations courses, followed by introductory courses 

        in the medium, then advanced courses like 3D Modeling and Animation, Interactivity, 

        Digital Video, or Art on the Internet. The focus in the program is on 

        the use of the computer as a means of artistic expression. All Digital 

        Art courses are cross-listed as New Media courses. We have offered a concentration 

        in Digital Art since 1998. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The New 

        Media Program at the University of Maine began in 1991 as a minor in Multimedia, 

        changed its name to New Media in 1998, and began offering a BA through 

        the Interdisciplinary Studies Program in Spring 2000. We expect to offer 

        a stand-alone major in less than two years. 

        Since its inception, the program has retained a strong multidisciplinary 

        approach, with faculty and students participating from art, music, English, 

        computer science, psychology, philosophy, education, mass communication, 

        etc. We are located within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and 

        offer courses both as New Media only, and cross-listed with many of the 

        departments listed above. The program does not reside within any one department, 

        but rather through the cooperation of many. </font>

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction? 

        </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">We believe 

        that technical-only instruction is a dead-end, as we always expect the 

        hardware and software to change. Our endeavor is to help students become 

        fluid thinkers who are able to adapt to a constantly changing environment. 

        We want them to be able to assess a problem, consider the resources available 

        to them (including technology, collaboration, previous examples, history, 

        etc.) and apply the best solution. We have a very liberal-arts minded 

        approach. Having said that, many of our classes offer a great deal in 

        terms of technical teaching, as it is important that the students are 

        familiar with the resources and tools available to them.</font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The New 

        Media Program is committed to a multidisciplinary approach, as we feel 

        that confining our investigations to one (or even a few) area(s) is limiting. 

        All of our current faculty come from their own disciplines, and came together 

        by way of a mutual interest in the possibilities of computers, and now 

        the Internet. </font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 

        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In the 

        Digital Art concentration, our students participate, as do all of our 

        Studio Art majors, in the dialogue about the gallery system, appropriate 

        venues for their work, and professional practices. As our New Media program 

        is not art-specific, the engagement is on a larger scale, including discussion 

        of industry, as well as cultural institutions. In my Art on the Internet 

        class, we have spent a great deal of time on this very question, because it 
        
        challenges the very nature of 

        the students' preconceptions about art. Part of that conversation deals 

        with the issue of the institutionalization that is happening in 

        the class itself, with the backdrop of Bookchin/Shulgin's Intro. to Net 

        Art 1994-1999 and David Ross' lecture to the CADRE institute as kind of 

        counterpoints in the discussion. </font>

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We are 

        now beginning to make those industry connections. We realize the financial 

        expense of the program, plus the academically political impact such "branding" 

        might have, both positively and negatively. </font>

        Can you describe the type of studio work that your digital media students 

        are primarily engaged in, and is theory and writing an important component 

        of your program? </b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The Digital 

        Art students create a wide variety of work, from 2D images to database-driven 

        interactive pieces, as well as digital video and animation. All courses 

        include discussion of contemporary theory, and most upper-level classes
