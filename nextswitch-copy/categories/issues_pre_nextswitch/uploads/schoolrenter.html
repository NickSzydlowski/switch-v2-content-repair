      The Stanford Digital Art Center, SUDAC, was founded in 1997 by Greg Niemeyer
and Joel Leivick as an extension to the Studio Program Stanford University
Department of Art and Art History. They renovated an old weaving studio and
installed basic media art tools such as a plotter and some scanners,
thinking that these tools would act like a well in a village: They would
draw together people with similar interests from different areas at
Stanford. This happened, and a basic SUDAC community formed. The
constituents of the community where students and professors from Art, Art
History, Design, History, and Computer Science. After that community was
established, Greg Niemeyer started forming a series of Digital Art Courses.
Their success attracted further resources, which allowed SUDAC to grow to
its present size. Despite considerable growth SUDAC is still a somewhat
irregular occurrence at Stanford University. It is best understood as an
atelier within the Studio Art program. This atelier status allows for great
flexibility and an spontaneous, entrepreneurial atmosphere, but does not
allow for scaling processes which would lead to an increased
institutionalization.</font>

        do you offer? </b></font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
      In keeping with the atelier atmosphere, with the small size of our program,
and with the rapidly changing nature of media art, we  have not established
any separate undergraduate degrees for SUDAC. Most SUDAC students major in
CS or in Art, and a growing group of students has reacted to the absence of
a Media Art Major by designing their own "Individually designed Majors". On
the graduate level, the Art Department offers an MFA in "New Genres". The
term emphasizes the notion that there is an art form concerned with newness.
This notion is important for the understanding of media art, genetic art,
and other art practices which engage specifically with emerging
technologies: The core topic of these practices is innovation. SUDAC also
offers a one-year visiting scholar position, which was previously occupied
by Sylvia Wyder, Miriam Dym, and James Buckhouse. For visiting scholar
applications, please contact Greg Niemeyer at <a href="mailto:otto@stanford.edu">otto@stanford.edu</a>. For all
other applications, contact Jill Davis at <a href="mailto:jill.davis@forsythe.stanford.edu">jill.davis@forsythe.stanford.edu</a>.

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?
        </b></font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
      SUDAC courses are designed to provide strategies for acquiring know-how. The
instructors do not presume that we know how to do things, but they like to
promote strategies for developing know-how about both mental and practical
aspects of art. Professors in the Art History department, such as Scott
Bukatman and Pamela Lee, are experts in developing theoretical approaches to
media art, and their and SUDAC's efforts are combined in the student's
experiences. </font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
      Media arts have influenced all other academic disciplines more than the
different disciplines have influenced media arts. The proof is that most
websites, flash files and QuickTimes from different academic disciplines
perform and appear in similar ways. If the areas had more influence on the
media, their particularities would have been manifested more distinctly in
the media they generate. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 
      Since media arts are a prevalent element of contemporary communications,
SUDAC naturally gets many requests for collaborations. These usually involve
solving communication problems. SUDAC staff and students do not reject these
requests, and often succeed at converting them into more genuine
collaborations, where all parties contribute equal amounts of questions and
answers. They are an important basis for developing viable academic
communities.</font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 
        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b></font> 
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      The Cantor Arts Museum under director Tom Seligman and curator Patience
Young has been very open to hosting SUDAC projects in the past. While media
arts present an audience challenge to museums, museums present a quality
challenge to media artists:<p>
Media art is designed in its very tools and interfaces to seduce, entertain
and absorb its audience, and thereby is effective at satisfying audiences in
large numbers. The challenge to museums is to generate equally large
audiences with equal ease.
<p>
Museums traditionally address deeper human experiences such as inspiration,
reflection and introspection. Such experiences are still rare in the young
discipline of media arts, and in that sense, museums offer media arts the
quality challenge.

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
      SUDAC receives most of its resources through corporate donations. These
donations are a result of congruent agendas. UPS funds courses dealing with
transportation and public spaces, Intel funds activities designed to advance
the role of computers in society, ILM supports our efforts to train students
with both technical and creative know-how, and software companies such as
Alias|Wavefront enjoy expanding their user base by offering products at
material cost. These relationships are based on realistic mutual goals. The
direct interest of hiring graduates is not a realistic goal. It could impact
our academic freedom and corporate hiring practices. Of course, students
want jobs when they graduate, and SUDAC positions itself as good source of
experiences to increase marketable skills, but a direct hiring goal would
hardly benefit either party.</font>

      Stanford is a great institution for
a universal academic experience. Although the Art Department and SUDAC are
small compared to a typical  art school, they are well integrated into the
broad network of all academic disciplines. Therefore, a typical Media Art
experience at Stanford would include extensive cultural studies and advanced
technical coursework. The Art Department has dramatically increased its art
and technology courses in the past three years through the addition of seven
new courses at SUDAC and through new courses by Prof. Paul DeMarinis. The
Department of Computer Science with Lorie Loeb and Chris Bregler, the Center
for Computer Music with Chris Chafe, and other departments offer courses
jointly with the Art Department. These joint courses further underscore the
integration of the Art Department with other departments in the context of
media art. <p>
Typical careers of our graduates include exhibiting artists, web designers,
technical directors for cinema productions, publishers, TV producers, and
interface designers</font>
