        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?
        </b></font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">TechBC is 
        a university with an applied research mandate. This focus on the applied 
        is carried through into the academic curriculum. In Interactive Arts we 
        have designed the curriculum to thread the theoretical knowledge with 
        the tacit knowledge of applied learning. This demands approaching theory 
        within activity-based learning and vice-versa. What is evident in fixing 
        an emergent discipline into a curriculum, in an interdisciplinary and 
        technologically evolving context, is that it is premature to assume a 
        defined theoretical knowledge base. This has challenged us to review our 
        assumptions of, in particular, art and design history, in both a traditional 
        sense and a revisionist sense which are both academically driven. The 
        challenges we are trying to meet are learner-centered, to provide an effective 
        socio-cultural theoretical framework for interdisciplinary learners (Interdisciplinarity 
        between the three program areas is explicit in our undergraduate programs, 
        especially our foundation year known as TechOne, the senior year and our 
        MaSC and PhD programs), to address a culturally diverse generation of 
        learners, and to draw on a technology context that draws more heavily 
        from entertainment, science fiction and the short history of computer 
        games. In addition, the socio-economic backdrop is a shift toward a networked 
        economy or society. This has resulted in specific courses that approach 
        theory in a problem based context that try to integrate cultural and technological 
        history, culture and popular arts, as well as addressing a contemporary 
        non-eurocentric view of art and design history. </font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">TechBC 
        is interdisciplinary at all levels of its curricula, from the undergraduate 
        to the graduate level. The ability to design three program areas concurrently, 
        and in an interdisciplinary way from the ground up is an early advantage 
        of ours. What has become apparent to me, is that it is as crucial, if 
        not more so, to define an interdisciplinary planning and administrative 
        structure within a university that can enable interdisciplinary curriculum 
        development. Interdisciplinarity is a structural issue that cannot be 
        viewed only on the front-end, as co-operation between two structurally 
        distinct departments, for example. The organization itself needs to adopt 
        a level of hybridity that can generate and maintain substantive interdisciplinarity, 
        and can allow for continuing adaptability. The structure requires the 
        ability to hybridize and develop emergent fields of study. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Having 
        said that, as your question makes clear, there are real issues of scope 
        in the area of interdisciplinarity and serious effort and collaboration 
        has to be put in around shared goals and outcomes, otherwise the scope 
        is unmanageable. An institution like TechBC, that formalizes interdisciplinarity, 
        has to formally unpack the term itself, and determine varying levels of 
        practice. We are both fostering and refining between related ideas like, 
        integration, hybridity, trans-disciplinarity, multi-disciplinarity, and 
        cross-disciplinarity. </font>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In real 
        terms, we have developed and delivered cross-program courses and developed 
        TechOne, our interdisciplinary undergraduate first year. The learners 
        all take the same program and decide in their second year what program 
        area to pursue and in the fourth or senior year, they come together again 
        in semester long, interdisciplinary project and team-based courses.</font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 
        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b></font> 
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We work 
        with a number of non-academic institutions and organizations. Much like 
        your earlier question, the level of post-disciplinarity involved in new 
        media has lead to us not privileging one group over another. Much of our 
        external contacts come from interdisciplinary research projects or existing 
        network connections that faculty bring, which is quite varied. Personally, 
        in this past year I've worked with MoMA, the Guggenheim, and Electronic 
        Arts Intermix in New York, as well as with Nokia and Credo Interactive.</font>

        Do you receive industry support or maintain relationships with companies 

        who are interested in your graduates? </b></font> 
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">TechBC is 
        mandated by the provincial government to contribute to the regional economy 
        through not only providing highly qualified graduates but through partnership 
        with industry. We work with a wide number of industry partners from Electronic 
        Arts, IBM, Nortel, Mainframe Entertainment, Credo Interactive, TacTex 
        and a number of other companies. We also have a Program Advisory Committee 
        made up of industry, cultural organizations and union representation. 
        There are an incredible number of opportunities for learners to work with 
        industry while at TechBC through faculty research projects, co-ops, and 
        partner projects.</font>

        of your program?</b></font> 
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> At this 
        point TechBC has completed its first cohort of learners at the foundational, 
        TechOne year. Its very early and it will be more clear in the later years 
        the nature of the learners' work. However, theory and writing is an important 
        aspect of the program and through courses like, Process Elements and The 
        History and Theory of Technology and Culture, and Business in a Global 
        Economy, an interdisciplinary framework for theoretical approaches begins 
        in TechOne. </font>

        Is there anything that is important for prospective students to understand about your program 

        that may assist them in choosing a place of study? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In the 
        Interactive Arts program we have been free to design a platform for an 
        emerging field on its own terms. Technology is part of the deeper socioeconomic 
        shift that interactive arts is a part of and is not an add on to an existing 
        and traditional art and design program. The chance to rethink an approach 
        to education and research has been capitalized on. This has resulted in 
        team-based learning, effective use of educational technology, outcomes 
        that speak to adaptability, and a conceptual, as well as tacit understanding 
        of the emergent practices for outcomes that will be realized three to 
        five years from now. The other issue to consider is the faculty and our 
        very active research in the emergent and leading edge aspects of new media 
        and its interdisciplinary applications that deeply informs our ongoing 
        curriculum development. </font>
