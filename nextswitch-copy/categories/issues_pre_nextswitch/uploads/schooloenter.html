      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Cogswell 

        Polytechnical College is in its 113th year of continuous education. Dr. 

        Henry Cogswell was one of San Francisco's first millionaires, making his 

        fortune from land speculation and his dental surgery practice during the 

        California Gold rush. Dr and Mrs. Cogswell eventually established and 

        endowed the college. The Computer and Video Imaging program was created 

        seven years ago to fill the increasing demand for computer graphic artists, 

        primarily 3D animators. We offer a traditional art foundation with specializations 

        in Character Animation, Digital Illustration, Game Design, Modeling and 

        Animation, Digital Motion Picture, Technical Director, and Web Design 

        and Development. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">

        </font></b></font><b>How your new media art endeavor's positioned within the academic 

        structure at your University? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">They are 

        the core of the Computer and Video program. Our goal is to train digital 

        artists to gain immediate and meaningful employment in their chosen industry. 

        We give students as much art theory and exposure to a fine art context 

        as we feel is appropriate, but our students are extremely focused on going 

        directly into a digital entertainment industry, so they will only respond 

        to a certain point. </font>

        do you offer? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The College 

        offers a Bachelor of Arts in Computer and Video Imaging, a Bachelor of 

        Science in Electrical Engineering, a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering, 

        and a Bachelor of Science in Fire Science. </font>

        </font></b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Computers 

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?  

        </b></font> 

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As much 

        as I would like to say we are able to offer a balance between theoretical 

        and technical instruction, we are a Polytechnical college, so we allow 

        a bias towards technical instruction. We try to consistently challenge 

        our students to look at their training and goals as just a means to an 

        end, but these are kids who have been enamored by computers since before 

        they could speak, so it is very difficult to pull them away from a reliance 

        on software as an end in itself. Our curriculum includes traditional sketching, 

        painting, figure drawing, 2D design, color theory, photography, and some 

        sculpture, art and film history, so students are getting a fair amount 

        of traditional academic art training, and they perform quite well in these 

        areas, but they are outstanding in their technical classes such as digital 

        video editing, digital audio concepts, 3D modeling and animation, and 

        advanced web development. 

      <p> As a faculty, we have to be careful not to project our own desires and 

        fine art biases onto our students. They do not dream of being fine artists, 

        they just want to make a living playing on the computer. After all, these 

        students don't want to sell shoes or wait tables or teach in order to 

        support their art habits as most of my peers have had to do. </font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The curriculum 

        of our web specialization is a bridge between our Engineering and Computer 

        and Video Imaging departments. It is a rare opportunity for art students 

        to work with engineering faculty and students. Our senior project class 

        work includes combined discipline courses such as Project Management, 

        Information Delivery, and Aesthetic Engineering. Business minded students 

        are encouraged to take Entrepreneurship courses such as Introduction to 

        Venturing, The Emerging Company, Managing the New Company, and International 

        Entrepreneurship. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Naturally, 

        we feel these classes offer unique cooperative learning situations that 

        are rarely available in an academic setting, but are a fact of daily life 

        in industry.</font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Only as 

        an educational tool. Students regularly visit museums as a part of the

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We receive 

        some equipment and supplies from industry, and our Industry Advisory Board 

        is very active in helping us revise and update our curriculum on a regular 

        basis, but our primary relationship is a feeder of their employment needs. 

        Recruiters keep our job coordinator very busy. Our students participate 

        in internships while they are in school, and quite often are hired on 

        before graduation. The numbers of our alumni listed in the credits of 

        animated feature and short films and computer games is growing at an incredible 

        rate. We currently have alumni working at industry giants such as ILM, 

        PDI, Pixar, Sega Games, Atari, and Will Vinton Studios, but we also have 

        hundreds of alums working in start-ups and up and coming companies.</font>

        of your program?</b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Our students 

        produce 3D modeling and animation for a variety of targets, including 

        game development, character animation, and film special effects. They 

        also develop web communications and entertainment. There is not an emphasis

        that may assist them in choosing a place of study? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Growth in 

        the Computer and Video Program, and a demand for a flexible media education
