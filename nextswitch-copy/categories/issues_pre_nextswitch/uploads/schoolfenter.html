        as a New Media arts Program and evolved into Art and Technology today. 

        Art &amp; Technology is an interdisciplinary studio art program in computer 

        mediated art, which includes 3D computer modeling, animation, digital 

        imaging, electronics, interactive robotic sculpture, holography, web based 

        works, multimedia, installation and sound. Graduate and undergraduate students 

        are encouraged to consider content and approaches that may not fit with 

        the traditional definitions of art, while acknowledging the structured 

        processes usually associated with technology and the sciences. In addition 

        to full time professors in this area adjunct professors in physics, glass, 

        photography, design, and printmaking bring expertise and knowledge to 

        these approaches, while demonstrating the Art and Technology's commitment 

        to an interdisciplinary environment. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The graduate 

        Students in Art and Technology have access to the Advanced Computing Center 

        for the Arts and Design (ACCAD) and several state of the art Macintosh 

        labs known as the Fergus Gilmore Media Arts Center, and the Emerging Technologies 

        Studio. Graduate students in Art and Technology will be utilizing Silicon 

        Graphics Workstations and high end Macintosh based multimedia equipment, 

        featuring; digital video, high resolution slide scanners, laser and inkjet 

        printers. The Art and Technology area supports two advanced holography 

        labs that are jointly administered by the Department of Physics and the 

        Art and Technology area. Our Robotics and Electronics lab consists of 

        test equipment, microcontroller programming workstations and production 

        tools, which allow the art and technology students to work on a component 

        level with building kinetic, robotic, interactive and sound installations. 

        </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Our primary 

        focus is helping students to discover their artistic voice utilizing some 

        of the tools and techniques listed above. Art &amp; technology is focused 

        on exploiting advanced technology and tools in a studio environment to 

        promote experimentation and realization of new forms, while developing 

        the unique vision and aesthetic of each of our students. </font>

        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We focus 

        on choosing the best media for the concept and not on technical training 

        per se. We believe and practice that the best way to technical prowess 

        is through a strong and inspired concept that drives learning with emotional 

        involvement. This means that our courses are both structured in what they 

        offer technically but that the expression within these courses is conceptually 

        driven. </font>

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program

        State University is a tremendous school with many of the departments and 

        areas that you mention. Our graduates and undergraduates find support 

        in learning from the areas you mention and many of the core GEC's for 

        the undergraduates are drawn from Literature, Computer Science, biology 

        and philosophy for instance. The media theory as it relates to Film and 

        Cinema theory and semiology comes primarily from our Art History area 

        and upper division seminar courses which are conducted by the Art Critical 

        Practices Area within the Department of Art. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> It would

        The Wexner brings world class speakers and performers which the Department 

        of Art utilizes as important lectures, while simultaneously the Art Department 

        brings guest lecturers in which are given residencies at the Wexner. For 

        example in the coming weeks Robert Irwin, Robert Rauschenberg, Mira Shor, 

        Frank Gehry and Calvin Thomkins will all be offering lectures at the Wexner 

        Center which our students will certainly attend. In the coming year I 

        will be holding an interdisciplinary lecture series which arises out of 

        a Betha Grant and all lectures will take place at the Wexner and we will
