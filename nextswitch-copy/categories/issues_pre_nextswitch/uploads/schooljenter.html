      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Art Center's 

        graduate MFA program in Communication &amp; New Media Design develops professional 

        design practice in the context of diverse media technologies. We investigate 

        interactive design theory, tools, user experience, and cultural context. 

        While developing core design competencies, our flexible curriculum also 

        responds to evolution in our field and prepares students for careers of 

        continuing innovation. Our graduates distinguish themselves as practitioners, 

        visionaries, entrepreneurs, and design intellectuals. The Art Center MFA 

        program in Communication &amp; New Media Design aims to produce the thought 

        leaders of our profession. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The MFA 

        in Communication &amp; New Media Design is a two-year program. During the 

        first year, students engage with the history and theory of new media in 

        seminars, hone their production skills in studios, learn directly from 

        visiting designers and artists, and devote a large percentage of their 

        time to the Super Studio, a team-oriented group project. During the second 

        year, the seminars and studios are devoted to more specific issues that 

        dovetail with the student's own research interests. The Super Studio 

        serves as both preparation and model for the student's individual master's 

        project, facilitating a connection between group and personal work. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The Graduate 

        Program in Communication &amp; New Media Design is distinguished from the 

        undergraduate offerings in that it is specifically designed to support 

        students in independent research towards a final production that pushes 

        the frontiers of new media design. Art Center has nine undergraduate majors 

        including Advertising, Environmental Design, Film, Fine Art, Graphic Design, 

        Illustration, Photography, Product Design, and Transportation Design. 

        Besides Communication &amp; New Media Design there are graduate programs in 

        Film, Fine Art, Theory &amp; Criticism, and Industrial Design (which combines 

        Environmental, Product and Transportation Design).</font>

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction? 

        </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Mastering 

        the tools of media creation is not an "unavoidable necessity," for us, 

        but rather the place from which students must start if they are to make 

        meaningful work. The program builds on Art Center's renowned design curriculum, 

        and adds technical classes that cover the range of tool sets necessary 

        to create fully formed projects in the new media, with studio courses 

        in programming, interactive design, motion graphics, 3-D modeling, Web 

        development and virtual worlds design. Equally important are the seminars 

        that create an intellectual context for these technical skills. Seminars 

        cover the history and theory of media, critical methods of analysis, interactive 

        narrative and classical story structure, the philosophical implications 

        of virtual systems, and the interweaving of architecture and imaging systems. 

        There are also special seminars and critiques devoted to hosting visiting 

        designers, artists, programmers, critics, and theorists. From these intellectual 

        and technical foundations, students develop a course of research and build 

        their own innovative master's projects and theses. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> There is 

        thus a strong discursive element to the program, with both history and 

        theory getting the attention and respect they deserve, and this is where 

        we most often intersect with fine art disciplines and discourses. To reiterate, 

        though, we are focused on the design disciplines.</font>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q4"></a>Q4</font></b></font> 

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In our program, 

        theory is definitely treated as a toolbox rather than a monolith that 

        must be "mastered." We obviously engage with the history of graphic design, 

        but devote equal attention to theoretical approaches that have been tested 

        in other time-based disciplines like film, television, and performance. 

        As design becomes digital, designers have to move fluidly into the realm 

        of performance and narrative. The practice of design moves from a strict 

        regime of visual problem solving into the more fluid fields of experience 

        creation, often unbounded in both time and form. Digital tools and media 

        demand a dynamic aesthetic. Contemporary designers must plan for movement, 

        must anticipate interaction, must understand narrative. While we develop 

        specific classes to deal with these issues, students are encouraged to 

        take seminars outside of Communication &amp; New Media Design, often in the 

        graduate programs in Fine Art and Theory &amp; Criticism. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The program 

        also explores entrepreneurial approaches to the practice of new media 

        design, exposing students to other models of intellectual property systems 

        - the film and software industries prime among these - in which creators 

        have been able to wrest a degree of autonomy, control, and equally important, 

        equity in the projects towards which they contribute. </font>

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 

        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We tend 

        to worry about this less than a digital arts program, but some of our 

        students have shown within galleries and museums both while they were 

        in school and after graduation.</font>

        Can you describe the type of studio work that your digital media students 

        are primarily engaged in, and is theory and writing an important component 

        of your program? </b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The studio 

        work ranges widely. A few recent graduate projects included: an on-line 

        interactive comic [Brent Wood, <a href="http://www.brambletown.com/" target="_blank">www.brambletown.com</a>]; 

        an electronic programing guide for interactive television [Jinhee Park,

        Lesson [Merlin Lembong, <a href="http://www.digitalplay.net/" target="_blank">www.digitalplay.net</a>]; 

        scalable information browsers [Chuck Harris, "Monstermesh"]; integrated 

        print/poster/Web learning environments [Elizabeth Pastor, "connecta!"]; 

        interactive, multi-dimensional installations [Michael Sy, "Y O U A R E 

        H E R E"]; and an on-line social issue documentary [Brad Gerstein, <a href="http://www.exopolis.org/" target="_blank">www.exopolis.org</a>]. 

        Students enrolled now are working on projects ranging from non-linear 

        digital narratives to the architectures of virtual worlds to contemporary 

        fashion publishing. Theoretical, historical and critical investigations 

        are always integral to the preproduction phase of graduate projects, and
