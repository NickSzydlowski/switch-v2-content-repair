<P><em>RTMark</em> specializes in artistic strategies that include hijacking corporate and political identities and challenging commercial conventions. RTMark assumed the identity of the Novartis corporation for openX. They also presented their video "Bringing it To You", in which RTMark mimics the info-mercial model - donning business suits to "sell" RTMark as a product. Ernest Lucha responded to my questions for RTMark.</P>
