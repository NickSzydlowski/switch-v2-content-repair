        an area within the SFSU Art Department that focuses on digital and emergent 

        technologies. It emphasizes a systematic and structured process of inquiry 

        as an underlying support to the experimental searching at the fringes 

        of the art world. The area has stressed the integration of the rational 

        and the intuitive, integrating strategies of planning and problem-solving 

        more typical of disciplines outside the arts. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Contemporary 

        science and technology are radically transforming the world. The culture 

        desperately needs artists to address these developments. The program encourages 

        students to become knowledgeable about world views, ideas, and tools of 

        these fields and to incorporate them in a non-superficial way into their 

        art making. Students are expected to achieve expertise in technological 

        areas in which most artists only superficially venture. Electronic technology 

        and mediated information distribution seem on the surface value-free, 

        but in fact, are causing major shifts in social interaction and the way 

        we perceive ourselves and reality. Artworks generated through digital 

        technology require some knowledge of strategies learned from semiotics, 

        communications studies, and cultural theory for critically understanding 

        technology's impact on culture. </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> CIA encourages 

        students to supersede, question, and challenge traditional notions of 

        what constitutes valid art media, contexts, and approaches. Students are 

        challenged to combine traditional media and to incorporate new media and 

        are encouraged to follow their ideas and artistic impulses even if they 

        don't take them into traditional validated art directions. Moreover, the 

        area supports students to pursue their inquiries into a wide spectrum 

        of arenas including performance art, interactive events, public art, earthworks, 

        art and architecture, installation, kinetics and robotics, video, computer 

        imaging, computer generated conceptual work, telecommunications, sound 

        art, art and science, integration with other disciplines, art and language, 

        conceptual art, guerrilla art, and hopefully activities that defy these 

        categories.</font>
