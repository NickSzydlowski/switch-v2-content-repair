      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We have 

        several interrelated programs in Computing and the Arts. We have the Center 

        for Research in Computing and the Arts (CRCA), an Organized Research Unit 

        of the University of California. Within the Visual Arts Dept. is an area 

        in Computing and the Arts. Within the Music Department is an area of Computer 

        Music. Both of these areas offer degrees with emphasis in Computing and 

        the arts and there is also an interdisciplinary major - the Interdisciplinary 

        Computing in the Arts Major (ICAM), a program between the Visual Arts 

        Dept. and the Music Dept. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> UCSD has 

        a long history of engaging computing in the arts. CRCA evolved out of 

        the Center for Music Experimentation, an important international center 

        for the development of computer music in the 70's and 80's. In the visual 

        arts, pioneering computer artist Harold Cohen founded CRCA in 1992, and 

        had been teaching computing in the arts courses since the early 80's. 

        </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In 1992 

        Sheldon Brown joined the Visual Arts department to develop the digital 

        media program. He was joined by Lev Manovich in 1995. Together they developed 

        the ICAM program, along with Miller Puckette, Dick Moore and Peter Otto 

        of the Music Dept. Adriene Jenik joined the Visual Arts Faculty in 1997. 

        Additional faculty include George Lewis in the Music Dept. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In 1999, 

        Sheldon Brown became Director of CRCA and Miller Puckette became the Associate

        Arts Major. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> In the

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction? 

        </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We teach 

        the technology at its most fundamental levels, knowing that the top levels 

        (the actual buttons etc... that one engages) will change by the time the 

        next academic year roles around. Also, it is at these fundamental levels 

        that the conceptual structures of these new media forms most clearly reveal 

        themselves. Students engage in a three pronged approach of theoretical/cultural 

        studies, artistic creation and technological exploration. </font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Looking 

        at your list, I would say that you've nailed much of what we engage. However, 

        I would also say that the history of art itself is an extremely important 

        component of mapping out influence and direction for the development of 

        work in this field. This lineage extends throughout the 20th century, 

        but also to pre-modernist and nonwestern art histories. With the structure 

        of CRCA and the ICAM major is inherently interdisciplinary, our program 

        looks across the range of arts, as well as closely to the computer sciences 

        and engineering. One other area not specifically mentioned in your comprehensive 

        list is Cognitive Science. </font>

        and students have an active engagement with the artworld, although not

        do a range of work including - installations, performances, digital prints,

        Is there anything that is important for prospective students to understand about your program

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Our programs 

        draw upon, and aim to bring together, ideas and paradigms from computer 

        science, art and cultural theory. It takes for granted that the computer 

        has become a metamedium and that artists working with computers are expected 

        to combine different media forms in their works. All of this makes the 

        program unique among currently existing computer art or design programs 

        which, on the one hand, usually focus on the use of computers for a particular 

        media (for instance, specializing in computer animation, or computer music, 

        or computer design for print) and, on the other hand, do not enter into 

        a serious dialogue with current research in computer science, only teaching 

        the students "off-the-shelf" software. The goals of the program are to 

        prepare the next generation of artists who will be functioning in a computer-mediated 

        culture; to give students necessary technical, theoretical and historical 

        backgrounds so they can contribute to the development of new aesthetics 

        for computer media; to prepare students to mediate between the worlds 

        of computer science and technology, the arts, and the culture at large 

        by being equally proficient with computing and cultural concepts; and 

        to give students sufficient understanding of the trajectories of development 

        in computing so they can anticipate and work with the emerging trends, 

        rather than being locked in particular software currently available on 

        the market. </font>
