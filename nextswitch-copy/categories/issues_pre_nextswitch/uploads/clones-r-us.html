<TITLE>Clones-R-US (Usman Haque)</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="white">

<P><em>Usman Haque</em> of DreamTech presented Clones-R-Us which is a web site based on the idea of made-to-order clones. The web site addresses not only the question of why people would want clones, but also includes an ordering process in which you can design a clone to purchase. This site commercializes a hotly debated, current issue and presents it in the world of utopian advertising, complete with a  collection of client testimonies. Usman Haque answered questions for DreamTech.</P>
