        <b>What degrees do you offer?</b> </b></font></p>

      <p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Department 

        of Media Arts is constantly seeking ways to meet the changing times of 

        new media production and culture by providing our students with a variety 

        of creative and critical perspectives. We're committed to becoming one 

        of the best media arts programs in the country, and we see new media as 

        key to that vision. We are growing, hiring new faculty, and investing 

        in advanced facilities. This is a very exciting time for us. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Department 

        is located in the College of Fine Arts, and thus we tend to be more concerned 

        with creative processes rather than, for example, communication research. 

        We offer a BA in Media Arts, a BFA in Film and Video Production, and a 

        MA. We are also discussing the possibility of offering a BFA in New Media. 

        Our curriculum emphasizes animation, cultural studies, film and video 

        production, industry studies (with a focus on Hollywood), and new media 

        theory/production. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The College 

        of Fine Arts is working to establish a program in Digital Arts -- with 

        BFA and MFA degrees -- and Media Arts is a committed partner in that endeavor. 

        Our students have numerous options. They can take courses in art, music, 

        dance, theatre arts, and humanities. And, the University administration 

        strongly supports our efforts in both spirit and with generous resources.

        </font></b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Computers 

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction?</b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We do not 

        divide theory from practice or practice from cultural criticism. Our curriculum 

        embraces the idea that at the heart of new media is a nexus of cyber theory, 

        interactive multimedia, non-linear storytelling, and cultural activism. 

        For example, one of my undergraduate courses, "Concepts in New Media," 

        teaches students basic theoretical and critical points -- but also has 

        them work in a team to create an interactive story. My graduate course 

        in new media, "Cyberspace: Theory, Culture, Design," investigates cyber 

        theories and cyber cultural methodologies -- and has the students visualizing 

        the various paradigms in Flash. They don't write traditional research 

        papers! </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> We nonetheless 

        realize that technical proficiency is key to a full understanding and 

        execution of new media, so we teach programs like: Photoshop, Illustrator, 

        Premier, Animation Master, Flash, Director, among others. We're developing 

        a series of lower-division courses that will teach students the "ins and 

        outs" of software and creative expression, thereby devoting upper-division 

        and graduate level courses to ideas, collaboration, processes, and "product." 

        We tend to put concepts before the details and intricacies of software, 

        realizing that technical proficiency is best accomplished in the pursuit 

        of an interesting idea. </font>

      <p>&nbsp; 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q4"></a>Q4</font></b></font> 

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b> </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> This is 

        a great question - one we've given a lot of thought. First, we see new 

        media as being inherently interdisciplinary, and thus we offer all perspectives 

        (theoretical, critical, historical, and creative). Our faculty come from 

        diverse backgrounds, and that diversity has a positive effect on the curriculum. 

        For example, Craig Caldwell, who is the chair of new media, has both MFA 

        and Ph.D. degrees, and just returned from a two-year stint at Disney animation. 

        I earned my doctorate from the Department of Film and Television at UCLA 

        (where I still teach on a visiting, commuter basis). I studied critical 

        and cultural theory. I'm also a practicing screenwriter. We recently hired 

        Lucy Petrovich, a new media artist, and she'll be teaching courses on 

        interactive design and multimedia authoring. Another colleague, Eileen 

        Meehan, will be teaching a graduate seminar on the political economy of 

        new media. Thus, our program is part art, part animation, part production 

        and storytelling, and part critical and cultural theory. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> We also 

        play well in the College sandbox. Our new media curriculum has strong 

        ties to the Digital Arts program mentioned above. We work closely with 

        faculty in digital photography, visual communication (design), music, 

        and theatre arts. And, we're developing a production lab for advanced 

        graduate students and faculty in Engineering, Art, and Media Arts. So, 

        one of the strengths of our program is that, while we work to maintain 

        a rigorous program, we don't erect or maintain "traditional" borders. 

        </font>

      <p>&nbsp; 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q5"></a>Q5</font></b></font> 

        How does your program engage with and relate to the traditional institutional 

        artworld of museums and other art institutions? </b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We have 

        strong ties to faculty in Art, and we're working on creating a virtual 

        gallery of new media art and storytelling. We need to create new paradigms 

        to exhibit these works until the art establishment catches up with this 

        medium. We are involved with digital conferences and online journals to 

        both exhibit work and create dialogues with people in the field. </font> 

      <p>&nbsp; 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q6"></a>Q6</font></b></font> 

        Do you receive industry support or maintain relationships with companies 

        who are interested in your graduates? </b> </font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Yes, and 

        more and more every year. The Department has gone out of its way to hire 

        faculty who have worked in the business. I worked for USA Networks and 

        the Sci-Fi Channel, and continue to pitch stories and "doctor" scripts 

        (I recently worked on a DreamWorks project). Craig Caldwell worked for 

        Disney animation. Lucy Petrovich works quite extensively with SIGGRAPH, 

        an international computer graphics conference, where she has made many 

        liaisons between students and the industry. Justin Wyatt, our director 

        of graduate studies, worked in marketing in Hollywood and writes for Detour. 

        Yuri Makino, who teaches film production, is a recent semifinalist for 

        the Sundance screenwriting competition. And Beverly Seckinger, who is 

        the Director of Production, recently finished shooting a documentary on 

        the aftermath of the Matthew Shepard murder in her own town of Laramie, 

        Wyoming. All of us work to create internships for our students, and in 

        turn use our relationship with the industry to further support our program. 

        Indeed, our new Internship coordinator, Mary Beth Haralovich, is working 

        hard to create and maintain a pipeline to numerous companies in Los Angeles, 

        San Francisco, and New York. </font>

        Can you describe the type of studio work that your digital media students 

        are primarily engaged in, and is theory and writing an important component of your program? </b> </font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We offer 

        courses in animation, non-linear storytelling, interactive design, visualizing 

        theory, multimedia authoring, screenwriting, and critical writing. In 

        Lucy Petrovich's multimedia class, for example, students are exposed to 

        interactive theory, and create stand alone CD-ROM projects that deal with 

        film analysis, post modernism, and self expressions. Our critical studies 

        courses emphasize writing, as we are committed to teaching students this 

        valuable -- and marketable -- skill! Some of our url's include: </font>
