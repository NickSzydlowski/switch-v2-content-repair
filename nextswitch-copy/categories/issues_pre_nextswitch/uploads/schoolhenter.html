      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The CADRE 

        Laboratory for New Media is a unique research program dedicated to experimental 

        applications of new information technology in the arts. The program began 

        in 1984 resulting from an educational initiative and national conference 

        on art and technology hosted by San Jose State University. In 1985 the 

        School of Art and Design committed itself to establishing a state-of-the-art 

        facility for experimentation and research in digital media. In the late 

        1980's CADRE hosted an additional three-conferences/art festivals of national 

        stature that provided a forum for the maturing artistic discourses of 

        art and technology. In 1991 Joel Slayton was appointed Director of CADRE. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> CADRE's 

        Digital Media Art Program emphasizes theoretical and critical discourse, 

        providing a context in which experimental and scholarly activities are 

        defined. The San Jose State University academic environment is informed 

        by the unique opportunities afforded to a metropolitan university located 

        in Silicon Valley. CADRE intentionally reflects the research culture, 

        orientation and dynamics of the immediate computing and electronics industry. 

        CADRE is strictly a fine art program. Current activity areas include computer 

        visualization, cross-media installation, digital video, interactive and 

        immersive systems, programming, information mapping and database visualization, 

        virtual reality and net art. Next year CADRE embarks on two new ventures; 

        wireless communications and biotechnology. CADRE special programs support 

        a Visiting Artists/Theorist Program, Annual Student Symposium, sponsorship 

        of digital media exhibitions and the publishing of SWITCH, CADRE's internationally 

        renowned net journal dedicated to critical and theoretical discourse. 

        Complimentary study programs are available in Electro-Acoustics, Interactive 

        Literature, Engineering, Computer Science, Theatre Arts, Library Science 

        and a variety of other disciplines.</font>

        Laboratory for New Media offers BFA, MA and MFA degrees in Digital Media 

        Art. Programs of study emphasize artistic experimentation within a context 

        of historical, cultural and theoretical study. The program is intended 

        for artists with a multi-disciplinary orientation who intend to specialize 

        in new media and who have a strong interest in contemporary theory and 

        research.</font>

        and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts. Yet there is also a 

        seemingly unavoidable necessity for students to learn technology skills in a constantly changing technological 
        
        environment. This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a 
        
        need for high-tech education. Does your program have a specific approach to pedagogy in new 

        media arts, especially as pertains to the balance or blending of theoretical and technical instruction? 

        </b></font> 

      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The quest 

        for discovering a pedagogy that serves to balance the technical and conceptual 

        is doomed to failure. Such an orientation merely lends itself to the modernist 

        tendency of technological advocacy and positions of techno-infatuation. 

        The 'unavoidable necessity' is for students to unlearn the 'technology-skills' 

        to which they have been indoctrinated, requiring pedagogy of confrontation 

        and anti-romanticism. CADRE assumes a world of theoretical contradiction 

        and malfunction. In such a world, one cannot conceptually advance or retract 

        particular hardware/software any more than one can' balance or blend' 

        a pertinent art history of new media. Neither technology nor history are 

        that simple. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Study at 

        CADRE emphasizes a confrontation with art through the development of systems 

        of interpolation and transposition involving the histories of art, science 

        and culture. When this is done from an informed perspective, that is, 

        from an inspired theoretical and philosophical position, the results are 

        often provocative and result in hybridized conditions of art. In which 

        case, specific skills are not at all arbitrary but neither are they completely 

        essential. The goal at CADRE is to manifest a conceptual coherence in 

        the selection of information systems with which to be engaged and what 

        one has to know about such systems to be engaged. </font>

        Theorists and practicing artists approach new media and network media 

        from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and cinema theory, communications 

        studies, literature, linguistics and semiology, fine art, activist art, computer science, information 

        science, engineering, philosophy, biology, and other fields are platforms 

        of theory and practice which have influenced new media and/or technology art. Which 

        interdisciplinary approaches are most influential in your program, and how is your program 
        
        integrated with other departments or programs at your institution? </b></font> 

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Art does 

        not require a platform outside of itself. It does require to be informed, 

        both by itself and by its context. This requirement reflects not so much 

        of an interdisciplinary character but rather the importance of art as 

        an insertionary function. Which, of course, can be defined as a complimentary 

        relationship or otherwise. In either case, a most significant factor is 

        the nature of approach. In consideration of new formations of author, 

        reader, participant and process, new media art practice begs the issue 

        of how to determine the necessary circumstance enabling artistic function 

        and appreciation. Art as insertion is something other than observation 

        and commentary, it emerges as its own perturbance in the system of how 

        art can function. </font>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> CADRE students 

        are encouraged to situate themselves within intellectual domains of pertinent 

        research. Curriculum in the undergraduate and graduate programs requires 

        cross-disciplinary study at an advanced academic level. Students are encouraged 

        to customize their education by forming specific relationships with other 

        programs and faculty across campus. Contemporary discourses in the information 

        sciences, cognitive sciences, physics, biology and philosophy are of critical 

        issue. CADRE desires to enhance its expertise with regard to art as non-linear 

        and self-organizing system, art as network, art as database, art as inferencing 

        and reasoning system, art as simulation and art as new media. CADRE remains 

        appraised of developments in popular culture including new models of art 

        as business, fashion and entertainment. </font>

        As an organization, CADRE sponsors numerous regional symposia and exhibitions
