I was brought in to continue building what Rebecca had begun,         along with Bill Seaman who works with sound, video and interactive installations.         We are in the School of the Arts, which consists of: Art, Architecture,         Music, Ethnomusicology and World Arts &amp; Cultures. </font></p>      <p></p>      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q2"></a>Q2</font></b></font>         <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>What degrees         do you offer? </b></font> </p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">B.A., MFA         (We are planning a Ph.D. program). </font>       <p>      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q3"></a>Q3         </font></b></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Computers         and networks are profoundly conceptual media in the context of literature and the arts.

This seems to demand both a very theoretical/art-historical approach to teaching as well as a                 need for high-tech education.

By exposing our undergraduate and graduate students         across traditional boundaries of knowledge, our program challenges them         to become critical thinkers. </font>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> This term         we introduced a graduate course, "Dematerialized Utopias," a trans-disciplinary         arts and technology symposium that was co-organized by Mary Kelly, chair         of the Department of Art, and myself. The notable speakers included Sandy         Stone (interactive media), George Lewis (music), Elizabeth Diller (architecture),         Matt Mullican (art), and Constance Penley (film).

This exchange consists of collaborative interactive         telepresence events which explore the current breakdown of definitions,         dualisms and geographical boundaries in a point to point net experience.         </font>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> f2f: New         Media Art from Finland arrives to our department this Fall.

(FFVA). During the month of October, we look forward to meeting         various Finnish artists and theorists who will be flown out to Los Angeles         through the FFVA foundation and who will present lectures at the EDA (Everything         Digital Arts) space, Dickson Art Center. This series marks the beginning         of a collaboration between the UCLA Department of Design and the Helsinki         Media Lab, and we will connect these lectures via video streaming over         the web to Helsinki during October 1st through November 1st, 2000. </font>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Since the         fall of 1999, the Department of Design and OnRamp Arts have successfully         initiated an alliance. OnRamp Arts provides opportunities for 250+ underserved         youth ages 11-18 to learn hands-on skills in digital imaging, multimedia         and World Wide Web production. OnRamp's programs bring together at-risk         youth and local artists, encouraging the exploration of new media, empowerment         through skills-based training, and community dialogue within the development         of arts and technology. OnRamp opened two years ago, by the efforts of         local Los Angeles artists and educators committed to the potential of         digital media within underserved communities, and has since doubled its         facility, programs, resources, and collaborative alliances.</font>      <p>      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#996666"><a name="q6"></a>Q6</font></b></font>         Do you receive industry support or maintain relationships with companies         who are interested in your graduates? </b></font>       <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The department         is a recipient of a number of software and hardware grants.

Sample topics include interface design,         virtual environments and information spaces, and design of behaviors for         inhabitants, agents, and avatars of these environments. Exploration of         installation work that tackles the problem of virtual worlds being exhibited         in physical spaces is encouraged.

One of the most important things to understand is that we are not         interested in teaching skills alone or preparing students for the job         market. We take it for granted that they will be employable, and demand         that they take advantage and keep an awareness of their environment, which         is a major research University in the country. </font>       <p align="right"><font color="#660099"><a href="schoolpenter.html" target="_self"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">top</font></a></font>     </td>  </tr></table><p></p></BODY>
