<TITLE>Olia Lialina</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="white">

<P><em>Olia Lialina</em> presented "Location='Yes'", a site which exhibits net.art from various artists, giving net.artists a chance to be shown, and even collected in a medium which is just beginning to be recognized, (or to be ignored), by the artworld. The fact that much (but not all) of the artworld has not recognized or understood the concept of net.art brought about this site. It gives artists permission to show instead of denying them.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> Please describe your project. What are the key issues and concepts of your project?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B>Problems and questions of net art representation on the net and offline.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> How do you position your work within the context of "Life Science"?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> Not really, for me openX is an independent and complete part of this exhibition.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> What is your impression of Ars Electronica so far?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> Only the openX area is interesting to me.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> Have you seen anything that you are particularly interested in?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> Not really.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> What are the differences between this project and your previous projects?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> "Location=Yes" is a more analytic than arty project.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> What are the structures and support systems that allow you to do your work?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> My personal computer.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> As an artist working in a technological or scientific crossover, are you developing alliances and working relationships with commercial or corporate research and development venues?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> Not yet.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> How do you envision art in the future regarding new technologies, new science and a new millennium? How do you envision your work in this context?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> I will continue explaining obvisous things to important; I hope it will make life easier for future artists.</P>

<B><P>Q:</B> How do you think the social dynamic of the network art community unfolds when we are together here in real time?</P>

<B><P>OL:</B> The fact that we are together in real space is what I really like about openX. They have the right intention of presenting real people who are doing interesting things online.</P></FONT></BODY>
