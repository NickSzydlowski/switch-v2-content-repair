<P><em>Heath Bunting</em> discussed "SuperWeed" as part of the irational presentation. "SuperWeed" is based on the idea of creating a weed that is resistant to pesticides. When planting a "Natural Reality SuperWeed kit 1.0", which includes seeds of several different pioneering plants, one assists nature in producing a mutated weed that can not be destroyed by products such as Monsanto's Round-upTM. The desired effect is a type of corporate terrorism on a very natural scale.</P>
